STEP BROTHERS: by Will Ferrell And Adam McKay Story By Adam McKay Will Ferrell John C Reilly 4/16/2007  INT. LARGE HOTEL BALLROOM --- DAY There is a medical conference in progress. Roughly 200 Doctors and Professionals listen on as a Doctor in suit and tie, DR. ROBERT DOBACK, 62, conducts a power point presentation on new hearing aids. * DR. ROBERT DOBACK ... the RTI cochlear implant is the state of the art hearing aid due to it's magnetic processor. The sound quality for the patient is digital and in multiple bands. But the most exciting new development is the BTE case which fits over the ear ... He meets eyes with a woman in the third row. She is NANCY * * * * * * * HUFF, 60. She is attractive and clearly intelligent. She * gives a smile back to Robert who suddenly becomes a tad self conscious. DR. ROBERT DOBACK ... this eliminates the need for ... uh ... a signal connector ... um ... I mean processor ... which ... He looks at her again. She looks away and smiles and then looks up. DR. ROBERT DOBACK Um ... I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have lost my place. This never happens to me. Let's go to the next slide. INT. HOTEL ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER MUSIC: AN ART TATUM JAZZ PIANO TUNE SMASH CUT TO: Nancy and Robert are furiously kissing and undressing each other. They fall onto the bed and then the floor. They speak fast and breathy to each other.
ROBERT: My name is Robert. I play racquet ball and I collect coins and I love Korean food ... * * * *
NANCY: Ohh! I love Korean food! My name is Nancy! I try and go up to wine country three times a year. The last man I made love to was named Ben and he had a beard and he was an eighth grade Spanish teacher ...
ROBERT: My favorite film of all time is the Dirty Dozen ...
NANCY: Oh my god, I love Lee Marvin!
ROBERT: Let's make love in the shower!
NANCY: Yes to what you just said!! They kiss and roll and slide towards the shower ... INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - FOUR MONTHS LATER 2. CUT TO: Music: The band finishes out the Art Tatum song we've been listening to. Robert and Nancy come out of a kiss, everyone cheers, they of course, are now just married, perched at the head of a dais. Robert clinks a glass, he and Nancy stand.
ROBERT: I just want to welcome all of you to what has become one of the greatest days of my life. Ooos and aahs from the guests in attendance.
NANCY: It really is a perfect day. Except for the shrimp.
ROBERT: Let me raise a glass to my son Dale. Honey, Dale and I welcome you into our home with open arms. We see DALE DOBACK, 40, Robert's son, sulking at one of the tables. * * * Laughter NANCY Today really is about family and creating new family and new love ... oh, I'm going to cry ... As you know my oldest son Derek couldn't be here because of an important fishing trip. But I've just learned we're going to have an addition to our new family. And no, I'm not pregnant.
ROBERT: I was worried for a second!
NANCY: My youngest son Brennan was supposed to be moving into his own place but he was recently let go from his job at Petsmart. So Brennan will be living with us! 3. BRENNAN HUFF, 39, storms out as well. Purposely knocking over a center piece.
BRENNAN: Thanks for telling the whole world Mom!
NANCY: Ok, I guess I wasn't supposed to mention the Petsmart firing. I didn't know that.
ROBERT: (to Nancy, off mic) Brennan's going to be living with us? Why didn't you tell me this before?
NANCY: Robert please. (and then to everyone) How about some fun music! Let's dance! The band takes their cue as Latin jazz kicks in. We see Brennan staring at Dale from outside the banquet hall window. Dale sees him and immediately Brennan walks away. CUT TO: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD-MORNING Latin jazz continues as a Moving van wipes across frame followed by a Volvo station wagon. INT. VOLVO Nancy drives while Brennan sits in the back seat. Beat of silence.
NANCY: Someone is pretty quiet back there. Are you nervous?
BRENNAN: I'm not going to call him dad.
NANCY: Brennan you're 39 years-old, I would not expect you to call him dad.
BRENNAN: Well I'm not going too. Ever! Even if there's a fire! INT. ROBERT AND DALE'S HOUSE-CONTINUOUS Robert and Dale sit at the kitchen table of their upper­ middle class home. They eat cereal.
DALE: We're men, Dad. We fart. We talk about pussy. We go on river boat gambling trips. We make our own beef jerky. And now that's all wrecked!
ROBERT: We have literally never done one of those things you just listed.
DALE: And now we never will! Doesn't that make you sad? 4. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * INT. VOLVO Another long beat of silence. Brennan is staring out the window.
NANCY: What if you and Dale get along great?
BRENNAN: (without looking at her) THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!! INT. ROBERT AND DALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN Robert is cleaning up. Dale is not helping at all.
DALE: Alright here's a scenario for you. What if Nancy sees me coming out of the shower and decides to come on to me. I'm looking good, still a little wet with the V of hair going from my chest to my ball hair and she says, "_Oh my god I've had the older one, now I want the younger version". And she grabs my thing.
ROBERT: (slams the dishes in the sink) Shut the fuck up! And put some clothes on, they'll be here soon. EXT. ROBERT AND DALE'S HOUSE 5. Giant moving truck pulling into frame. The car pulls up behind the truck. Robert runs out the front door to greet Nancy. The movers start to unload the truck. Dale stands in the door jam holding, not even lifting, a ten pound hand weight while eating a bagel. Their house is a nice three bedroom suburban slightly upper middle class home.
ROBERT: There you are. You look so cute in your moving clothes. How was it?
NANCY: Oh fine, the movers did everything. * * *
ROBERT: Where's Brennan?
NANCY: He's still in the car. It was a rough drive. He had Burger King and that stuff is laced with sugar and the trans-fats. He just doesn't react to it well. (looks up) Hi Dale.
DALE: Hi Mom! Mommy ... I mean mom-mommy­ mother ... Nancy. 6. Moving gets underway. Robert and Nancy go inside the house. We see the Volvo just parked on the street. Dale looks on, half-lifting his weight. Finally Brennan gets out and walks to the beginning of the front walkway, facing Dale. They stare at each other for a beat. Beat. BRENNAN Hey.
DALE: Hey.
BRENNAN: I'm Brennan.
DALE: I'm Dale.
DALE: I guess we're stepbrothers MUSIC kicks in: "She" by Greenday TITLE: STEPBROTHERS They stand there for another beat and then Brennan gets shy and bolts back to the car, jumps in it, burns rubber and takes off. 7. EXT. ROBERT AND DALE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY We see movers still moving furniture into the house, Brennan pulls back up in the car, gets out and stands there looking at the house. Dale comes running out the front door, stops and looks at Brennan. They are like two elks staring each down. Suddenly, Brennan bolts back in the car and takes off. EXT. ROBERT AND DALE'S HOUSE - EVEN LATER The movers are finishing with a few items when Brennan pulls up again and gets out of the car. Dale once again comes out of the house and looks at Brennan. They have the same stand­ off. Brennan after a beat gets back in the car and drives off. INT. HOUSE - NIGHT Robert is setting the table for dinner while Nancy cooks and Dale watches The Real Laguna Beach on TV. Dale sees through the main window of the living room that Brennan has parked across the street and is staring at the house.
DALE: Brennan's back.
NANCY: He must be starving by now ... Nancy goes to the door.
NANCY: Brennan, honey! Why don't you come in?
BRENNAN: No!
NANCY: I'm making chicken nuggets!
BRENNAN: Which kind?
NANCY: The kind with the crunchy skin!
BRENNAN: But with the dark meat? Beat. NANCY No, the white meat and the crunchy skin!
BRENNAN: Okay! Brennan jogs towards the door. INT. DINING ROOM --- TWENTY MINUTES LATER 8. The whole family is seated for dinner. Dale and Brennan sit at opposite ends of the table. Beat. NANCY So Brennan while you were driving around today, Dale told me he's really into Kung Fu. And I told him that you're really into Kung Fu as well.
BRENNAN: I have a green belt.
DALE: I don't believe in belts. But I once killed a doberman pincher with my bare hands.
ROBERT: That's not true Dale. Don't be ridiculous.
ROBERT: Dale has a pretty good head for business. He's hit a dry spell recently when it comes to employment, which is why he's been staying with me for the past five to ten years.
NANCY: What have you been working on recently Dale? * * * *
DALE: I manage a baseball team. Fantasy league. And I do a lot of large bulk sales.
ROBERT: He's been mostly taking apart our second car and selling it part by part on Ebay.
DALE: It's a 96 Mercury Zephyr. The blue book is 3600 but when you sell it part by part you're looking at 4000 easy. Plus I've really been working on getting my cholesterol down.
ROBERT: That's not really a business venture. But what about you Brennan? I know you worked at PetSmart recently.
BRENNAN: That's right Mr. Dobak.
ROBERT: Please call me Robert.
BRENNAN: I worked at PetSmart for two months. Before that I worked at CVS for four months. Before that I worked at Costco for three months. Before that I worked at Walmart for two months. Before that I worked at Sam Goody's records for three weeks. Before that I worked at Blockbuster video for two and a half months. Before that Barnes and Nobles for four months. That was a good job. Before that I worked at Boston Market for three months. Before that I worked Home Depot for four months.
NANCY: Ok that's enough, Brennan.
BRENNAN: Before that I worked at Sharper Image for two months. (MORE) 9. BRENNAN (cont'd) Before that I worked at Wahoo's Fish Tacos for nine days-
NANCY: Brennan I said stop!
BRENNAN: Before that I worked at-
NANCY: Stop! Stop it!
ROBERT: Jesus Nancy!
NANCY: I'm sorry. (beat) Brennan's real talent is that he's a very gifted singer.
BRENNAN: It's true. I'm really, really good.
DALE: How good?
BRENNAN: Like really, really good.
DALE: Like as good as Rod Stewart?
BRENNAN: Yes, definitely as good as Rod Stewart.
ROBERT: Oh. Well I look forward to hearing you sing.
NANCY: The only trick is, Brennan is very selective about who he sings in front of. I'm his mother and I've only heard him sing twice.
DALE: I'm a pretty good singer too. And I'll sing right now. (singing) HOLD ME CLOSER TINY DANCER-
BRENNAN: That's cute. I remember when I had my first beer. 10. *
DALE: That doesn't make any sense!
ROBERT: Alright both of you back off. Now the sleeping arrangements are going to be a little different. Dale refused to give up his office/drumroom. So Brennan you're going to be sharing a room with Dale. But seeing how the both of you will be getting jobs soon and getting your own places, it's not going to matter. Dale why don't you show Brennan where he can put his stuff.
BRENNAN: Good night Mom. Good night Mr. Dobak! Dale reluctantly leads Brennan to their room. INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 11. Dale carries a couple of Brennan's bags as they stop in front * of a room. * DALE * Before I show you our room, I want * you to look in here. INT. "OFFICE" - CONTINUOUS * This is a sparse room with foam padding on the walls, a shitty drumset, a DJ mixer and turntables, and some weights.
DALE: Ok here's the deal. See this room? This is my office and my beat laboratory. This is the one rule of the house. Don't ever, ever, touch my fucking drumset. Do you understand? There I said it nice and cool and calm and polite. Everything is casual.
BRENNAN: I gotta tell you. There's nothing cool or calm or casual about anything you just said.
DALE: Ok. So I so see you're making this hard. Let me turn up the volume. Don't ever touch my fucking drumset. Don't fucking touch it! Don't fucking touch it! And if you think you're going to be all sneaky and cool and try to touch it when I'm not around, I will know!
BRENNAN: Look, I get it!
DALE: Good. 12. * * DISSOLVE TO: INT. NANCY AND ROBERT'S BEDROOM- THAT NIGHT * Robert is in bed reading a big non-fiction book on Middle * Eastern history as Nancy enters and gets under the covers. * NANCY * I think they're still feeling each * other out... * ROBERT * What's that? * NANCY * Dale and Brennan. I just checked on * them. I think it's a feeling out * process. * ROBERT * So I've been meaning to ask you. . . * what happened with Brennan? I mean, * your other son Derek is quite * successful... * NANCY * Believe me I've tried to figure it * out. Certainly when Peter and I * split it was hard for him. But I * think it's more than that. * Brennan's always thought that he * could pursue something and be great * right away and then when he's not * he quits. I think that's why he * doesn't sing in public. * (MORE) NANCY (cont'd) I remember one time Brennan convinced everyone he was going to be on this TV show called American Gladiators. Have you ever heard of it?
ROBERT: I'm familiar with the program. Yes. We see quick flashbacks of the story Nancy is telling.
NANCY: He told everyone in town that it was a done deal but two minutes into the try out he pulled his quad muscle and was on the ground crying louder than I've ever heard anyone cry. For months after that the whole town would call him Nitro and dump trash on our front lawn. We finally had to move to a different township.
ROBERT: They don't mess around on American Gladiator. If you walk in there like a boy scout you will get your ass handed to you. Brennan should have known that.
NANCY: Well what about Dale? I mean let's face it ...
ROBERT: Dale's going to be fine. If anything he sometimes tends to coast off of my success. He's always asking me why he can't join the family business.
NANCY: But you're a medical Doctor.
ROBERT: I've explained that to him. But he always just says "It's all about who you know."
NANCY: Well maybe this fresh start will get them going. 13. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
ROBERT: I love you. I swear, you have such a spirit. He kisses her and turns out the light. EXT. HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING 14. Nancy pulling out in her Volvo. Robert and Dale leaving in Robert's Audi. Brennan says goodbye from the front door.
BRENNAN: Goodbye Mom. Goodbye Mr. Dobak. I'm just gonna read through the want ads. As soon as the cars pull away Brennan runs into the house and up the stairs to the drum set. EXT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDING- LATER Robert drops Dale off in front of the building. Dale confidently gets out of car with briefcase and bounds up the concrete steps to the front. EXT. TALC PHARMACEUTICALS - PARKING GARAGE - SAME TIME Nancy is pulling into her parking spot. INT. OFFICE/DRUM ROOM - SAME TIME Brennan is hammering away at Dale's drum set. Playing as hard as he can. He doesn't really know how to play. INT. EXAMINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER Robert is with patient, checking a new fangled hearing aid * * * * * * with a diagnostic instrument. * INT. SLEEK OFFICE - SAME TIME Dale is seated across from BARRY, 28, a slick financial analyst.
BARRY: You've got some very intriguing items on your resume Dale. Beat. DALE I thank you for that Barry.
BARRY: I think it's great that you operate a "Beat Laboratory". I also see here that you enjoy "kicking back and takin it breezy." What exactly does that mean?
DALE: It's just how I do it. I take things breezy and try not to get crazy. I thought it would be good if my resume showed some of my personality.
BARRY: Ok, regardless. You need to have an MBA to even be considered for this position.
DALE: Oh that's a typo. I have one.
BARRY: That's a pretty serious omission. So where did you get your MBA from?
DALE: Pretty small, little commuter school. You've never heard of it, not in a million years.
BARRY: Well you have to tell me.
DALE: University of Michigan.
BARRY: Get the fuck out of my office. Seriously dude, get out of here. EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 15. CUT TO: Dale is getting off the train and beginning to walk. 16. INT. FRONT DOOR Dale walks in to see Brennan laying on the couch, watching the View. He quickly buttons up his pants.
DALE: Hey.
BRENNAN: Hey.
DALE: Were you masturbating to the View?
BRENNAN: Yeah. Just to the young one.
DALE: Oh. I'm gonna go hit the skins. Dale walks up the stairs and Brennan goes back to watching tv. INT. "OFFICE" Dale checks his drum set to see if anything is out of place. We see quick cuts of the drumsticks resting on the snare drum, the base pedal, the crash cymbal and then quick cut back to the drumsticks. Close-up on the drumsticks. Closer on one of the sticks, where we notice a notch in the head of the stick. CLOSE-UP OF DALE'S FEET Running down the stairs. INT. LIVING ROOM Brennan is on the couch, flipping through the channels, eating a fruit roll-up
DALE: Hey man. Did you touch my drumset?
BRENNAN: What? No, of course not. 17. Dale stands there for a beat, while Brennan flips through the channels.
DALE: It looks like someone touched my drumset.
BRENNAN: Oh, cause I didn't touch it. Another beat.
DALE: Did you touch my drumset?
BRENNAN: I said no!
DALE: Did you ... touch ... my drumset?! Brennan does not respond. He keeps flipping through the channels. Dale grabs him, violently.
DALE: Hey!! Did you touch my drumset?!!
BRENNAN: Get the hell off me!
DALE: I know you touched my drumset! The left stick is out of place. I keep a mental image where those sticks are when I leave the house and the left one was moved. Brennan scrambles up off the couch. They both square off.
BRENNAN: You are fucking crazy man! You are out of your mind! I haven't been within a 100 feet of that drumset all day!
DALE: Fuck you Brennan! You played my drumset and I wanna hear your mouth admit it!
BRENNAN: If you don't get outta my face right now, I'll go Michael Dudakoff on your ass!!
DALE: Swear on your mother's soul that you did not touch my drumset!
BRENNAN: I don't have to swear to shit!
DALE: That's cause you touched my drumset, you fuck nad! Brennan starts to run up the stairs.
DALE: Where you going?
BRENNAN: Now I'm gonna touch your drumset! I'm gonna put my ballsack on that drumset!
DALE: I'll fucking stab you if you do that! I swear to God! I SWEAR TO GOD! ! ! ! ! ! INT. "OFFICE" - CONTINUOUS 18. Brennan bursts into the room and starts to take his pants off. Proceeds to rub his ballsack on the drum kit.
BRENNAN: Oooo yeah. There we go. Don't wanna miss a spot. Jon Bonham's playing Moby Dick for real!!! Dale bursts into the room, half crying.
DALE: Noooo! Get the fuck off. Aaaraggahh! ! ! Dale tackles him and they just begin brawling amidst the drumset. CUT TO: * * * INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -CONTINUOUS Nancy is seated at a conference table with three other pharmaceutical reps, going over sales packets.
NANCY: The place is called L'Grange over on Olive and right now they have their fall tasting menu and it ... is ... absolutely ... delicious. They music however is so loud, it's disconcerting. That's the only thing. INTERCOM (V.O.) Nancy call on line seven.
NANCY: Thank you, Miles. She pick up the phone.
NANCY: Hello. Hi Jules. What? Really? Oh my god, no, thank you for calling. Hangs up the phone.
NANCY: That was my neighbor. Apparently there's some kind of incident going on at my house. INT. LIVING ROOM 19. Brennan and Dale roll down the stairs and land in the living room. They immediately stand and start punching each other. Dale slams Brennan into the dry wall, making a sizable indentation. There is also now a ferocious, barking German Shepherd at the front window, trying to get into the house. *
DALE: You fuckin' fucker!!
BRENNAN: I'm gonna douse that drumset in shit and piss!!
DALE: Just admit you played it! 20.
BRENNAN: I'll never admit it!! Never!!! Brennan flings Dale across a coffee table and then makes a break for it out the front door. EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Brennan runs out the front door and the German Shepherd * immediately starts nipping at his legs. This stops Brennan in his tracks which allows Dale to catch up to him. They resume throwing punches at each other, while the dog barks at them.
DALE: Don't ever touch my drumset!
BRENNAN: Shut your fuckin mouth! Nancy pulls up in her car.
NANCY: What is going on?! She gets out of her car and runs up to the fight.
NANCY: Stop this! Please stop! She tries to break up the fight and the Ge=an Shepherd attacks her.
NANCY: Oh my god! Help me!
BRENNAN: Mom!! Dale keeps fighting Brennan. INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE Robert is talking to a fellow DOCTOR, 48.
ROBERT: It is the best risotto I have ever had. CUT TO: *
DOCTOR: And the name of the place is L'Grange?
ROBERT: Yes, L'Grange. I'm not going to lie to you, it's not cheap and the music is alarmingly loud. His phone rings.
ROBERT: Hello. Okay, you're going to have to stop screaming. No, do you understand I can't understand you when you scream Nancy! What?! I'm coming right away. He hangs up the phone.
ROBERT: I'm sorry Jeffery, apparently there is a savage fight going on in my house between my son and stepson and I have to leave right away. And please can you refrain from telling anyone about this?
DOCTOR: You mean about L'Grange?
ROBERT: No! About my son and stepson!
DOCTOR: Oh, of course Robert. EXT. HOUSE, FRONT LAWN 21. Dale has a baseball bat. Brennan has golf club as they continue to try to hit each other. Six other dogs have joined the fracas as twelve neighbors, in groups of two and three all watch. Nancy is spraying the dogs with a hose and screaming. After a moment of this, Robert pulls up and runs out of his car.
NANCY: Please stop!! Oh honey thank god! They're like animals!
ROBERT: What is going on! For Christ's sake, Dale! Brennan! Let's cut the shit! Cut the shit!! Do you hear me?! They're not listening at all and continue to fight.
DALE: Did you touch my drumset?!
BRENNAN: You fuckin weirdo!
ROBERT: Cut the shit! 22. They simultaneously swing and connect with each other's skulls. Knocking the other one out and both falling to the ground at the same time. We IRIS OUT as we hear Nancy's voice. NANCY (V.O.) Why? Why? CUT TO: INT. HOUSE - NIGHTFALL Brennan and Dale both sit with tv trays, their heads wrapped up with ice packs watching Game Show Network.
CU OF FULL FRAME TV: The tv goes to black as Robert steps in front.
DALE: Hey what are you doing dad?
ROBERT: Okay, here's the deal. Number one, you're gonna fix the fuckin' damage to the drywall, right away! That's the first thing. No questions. Number two: you have eight weeks to get a job and find an apartment. No screwing around. No extra time. That's that!
DALE: Dad why are you talking to me like that? I'm your son.
ROBERT: What I saw today was the worst behavior, by two grown adults, that I have ever witnessed.
NANCY: We are not joking around guys. This is not a stand-up comedy routine. I watched two wild animals out there. Brennan I know how wonderful you can be. And Dale your father has told me, what a gentle, kind soul you are. He told me how you carved that special wooden flute and you used to play it, when you were little. But today I was looking at two werewolves. And over what? Whether someone did or did not touch a drumset. Do you hear how that sounds?
BRENNAN: Mother I agree, it sounds crazy. But for the record, I did not touch the drumset.
DALE: You rubbed your nuts on my drumset.
BRENNAN: I'm going to punch you in the concussion.
ROBERT: Ok that's that! No tv for a week!
BRENNAN AND DALE: What?!
NANCY: Nope guys! You really pushed our buttons. The remote stays in Robert's wall safe! And that's it!
DALE: This fuckin sucks! 23.
NANCY: I suggest you both get ready for bed. Brennan, your brother Derek is coming over tomorrow night with his family and I don't want you tired and cranky.
DALE: This house is a fuckin' prison!! INT. UPSTAIRS -2 AM THAT NIGHT MUSIC: DREAMY VIBES 24. DISSOLVE TO: We pan across Nancy and Robert asleep in their bedroom and continue panning through the walls over to Brennan and Dale who each sleep in separate single beds in the same room. Brennan gets up out of bed. We can tell from his half closed eyes and clumsy manner that he is sleep walking. He walks out of the room. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -CONTINUOUS Brennan sleep walks in the hallway making feint groaning sounds as he paces back and forth aimlessly. Then we see Dale there also pacing back and forth. He too is sleep walking. INT. KITCHEN -A MINUTE LATER We see the dark empty kitchen lit only by moonlight. After a beat Dale enters clumsily and goes towards the fridge. He opens it and finds a half pound of turkey cold cuts. He binge eats the turkey with grunting sounds all while still asleep. Then Brennan walks in and starts to fumble in the cabinets for a coffee mug. He then begins grinding coffee beans, pouring the grinds into the mug, motioning like his sipping and then dumping them on the ground, over and over again. Dale is done with the cold cuts and now reaches for a bottle of soy sauce, which he begins guzzling. Brennan is in the foreground of the shot walking in tight circles.
DALE: Umphrfff. Spaceshuttle. *
BRENNAN: I'm gonna catch Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol is so fast! INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM - MORNING 25. CUT TO: Dale and Brennan are fast asleep in their beds, mouths open while Dale holds a loaf of bread, his mouth is smeared with mustard. Both of them are snoring hard. INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Nancy enters freshly dressed for work, followed by Robert.
NANCY: I don't know if he ever got back to him- Oh no!
ROBERT: Dale must have left the back door open, raccoons got in.
NANCY: Actually, Brennan was probably sleep walking. He hasn't done it in quite awhile. It must have been the change in surroundings.
ROBERT: Dale sleep walks too.
NANCY: You've got to be kidding me!
ROBERT: No, he's done it for years. He doesn't usually make a mess like this.
NANCY: I think I'm gonna cry. Look at this kitchen.
ROBERT: I'm going to talk to Scotty about getting these guys medicated. * * 26. INT. GUYS BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING Both guys are still asleep, snoring. We hear the alarm, you get the sense it's been beeping for a long time. The clock reads 11:20. Finally Dale stirs and shuts it off.
BRENNAN: Oh no!
DALE: What?
BRENNAN: My brother Derek is coming tonight with his family. INT. DEREK'S CAR CUT TO: We see DEREK, Brennan's brother, he's a very handsome, George Clooney-looking type guy, driving a Mercedes SUV. Sitting next to him is his wife, ALICE, 39, a quiet yet attractive brunette. In the back seat are their three perfect children TOMMY, 12, TREVOR, 10 and TIFFANY, 8. They are all singing Guns n' Roses, "Sweet Child of Mine". They sing this in perfect a capella with each family member having a specific * solo or harmony.
ALL: SHE'S GOTTA SMILE THAT IT SEEMS TO
ME: THAT REMINDS OF ME, OF CHILDHOOD
MEMORIES: 
DEREK AND ALICE:

TIFFANY: SWEET CHILD 0' MINE
DEREK: Tommy you're the oldest, I'm counting on you! Sing!
TOMMY: SHE'S GOT EYES OF THE BLUEST SKIES
AS IF THEY THOUGHT OF RAIN: 
I HATE TO LOOK INTO THOSE EYES: 
AND SEE AN OUNCE OF PAIN: 
DEREK: Nice vibrato Alice go!
DEREK: No .... no .... Jesus, god 27.
ALICE: 
HER HAIR REMINDS ME: OF A WARM SAFE PLACE no! ... terrible ...... Derek's WHERE AS A CHILD I'D HIDE
AND PRAY FOR THE THUNDER: 
AND THE RAIN: TO QUIETLY PASS ME BY got to save it with the solo Derek starts to do a air guitar solo of the song and almost loses control of the car.
ALL: Ahhh
DEREK: Back to the chorus!
ALL: OH-OH-OH-OHHH SWEET CHILD 0' MINE! * 28. EXT. HOUSE -DUSK The Mercedes SUV pulls into the driveway of the house. Nancy comes running out followed by Robert. Dale is peaking out the front door.
NANCY: They're here! Oh Derek, honey, so good to see you. Hi Alice! Derek hugs Nancy. Nancy hugs all of her grandchildren. INT. DINING ROOM -HOUR LATER Everyone is seated at the table, minus Brennan. All the children are eating with perfect table manners. Robert has just finished a story.
ROBERT: And I told him, you're a congressman and you're about to be indicted, you might be better off without a hearing aid. Everyone laughs.
DEREK: That's hilarious Robert. You are a gifted storyteller.
ROBERT: Why thank you Derek. People do enjoy hearing that one.
NANCY: We were so sad that you guys couldn't come to the wedding.
ROBERT: We completely understand Derek. You were busy fishing right? With Mark Cuban?
DEREK: Well not just Mark Cuban, but Ralph Lauren, Pat Riley and super-chef Bobby Flay.
ROBERT: That's impressive. God that's impressive.
DEREK: Yeah it went real well. We were down in the southern part of the Gulf, fishing Bonita. Robert, you ever been to the southern part of the Gulf, when the Bonita run?
ROBERT: No, but I've always wanted to. It's supposed to be amazing.
DEREK: Amazing is not the word.
DALE: Are Bonita big fish?
ROBERT: Dale don't interrupt the man while he tells a story.
DEREK: No that's fine Robert. Yes it's what's called a trophy fish. So they're big. But now I forget where my story was going.
ROBERT: Dammit Dale!
NANCY: He was just asking a question.
DEREK: Hey don't be mad at Dale for wrecking the story. Truth is, you can read it in next month's issue of Esquire. I typed it up on my laptop as soon as it happened and sent it in.
ROBERT: Dammit you're impressive! I can't stop looking at you!
DEREK: By the way, where's my lil' bro, Brennan?
NANCY: He's not feeling well. 29.
TREVOR: I hate uncle Brennan.
ALICE: Trevor don't speak about Uncle Brennan that way.
DEREK: It's alright Alice. This is the real world. Let him express himself. So Dale, you obviously have a very impressive father- We see that Robert is smiling like an idiot.
ROBERT: (to himself) Come on.
DEREK: What do you do?
DALE: Well where would you like me to start?
DEREK: How about with how you earn your primary wage?
DALE: I'll tell you what I do. (thinking of it as he goes along) I'm a ... professional ... body builder .... and .. trainer .. of show ... horses ... incorporated.
ROBERT: Dale's unemployed!
DALE: Dad!
ROBERT: Well it's the truth. Doesn't mean he's not without talents. He's done some wonderful drawings. There's one of them on the fridge over there. But right now we're just hoping and praying that he can get a job somewhere, maybe at a car wash or the airport. Get himself into a one-bedroom apartment and out of the house. 30.
DALE: You know, fuck you dad! Dale gets up and storms out.
TIFFANY: Fuck you Dale!
ALICE: Tiffany!
DEREK: Babe he started it. I never mind my children finishing it. Robert tries to cover the awkwardness.
ROBERT: Don't worry about Dale, he'll be fine. So Derek, I gotta ask you, have you been to Cuba? 31. CUT TO: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS Dale walks across the backyard to a tree fort in the backyard. INT. TREE FORT Dale comes climbing up into the fort, already seated in there is Brennan, reading an old playboy magazine to the light of a Coleman lantern.
DALE: Hey.
BRENNAN: Hey. Dale climbs up, grabs a Playboy and sits.
DALE: You were right about your brother.
BRENNAN: Yep. He's a dick. You got a pretty great collection.
DALE: Thanks man. INT. KITCHEN - TWENTY MINUTES LATER Robert and Nancy are cleaning up the dishes.
ROBERT: I have to tell you Nancy, Derek is one hell of a guy. What should I call him? Stepson? Or should I just call him son?
NANCY: You just call him Derek. Okay? That's all you have to call him. EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 32. Brennan and Dale are still looking at Playboys. Dale hands Brennan one.
DALE: Here check this one out. It has that lady from Law and Order, Special Victims Unit. It has those black and white, arty photos but she shows tons of bush.
BRENNAN: Cool. Derek pops up through the floor hatch.
DEREK: What's up faggot! You're not going to come down and say hi to me?
BRENNAN: Hey Derek.
DEREK: I like your guys set up here. This is ridonkulus! Now let me get this straight. Dale you're forty years old and Brennan you're thirty-nine. And both of you are sitting in a tree fort, reading playboys? This is actually happening? The guys say nothing.
DEREK: Great. I just want to be clear about that.
DALE: What's your problem man?
DEREK: I .don't have a problem. In fact, I have the opposite of a problem. I made five hundred fifty K last year. I run my own business selling and leasing executive helicopters. Last month I bought Sandler's original microphone from The Wedding Singer, on Ebay, for twenty­ two thousand dollars. I waited until the last second and then doubled the bid.
BRENNAN: Why didn't you just bid a little higher than the last bid?
DEREK: Shut up. Look, mom made me come up here and offer both of you jobs. I'll be honest, I don't want to do this, at all. You guys gross me out. But I figure what the heck, it might be fun having two clowns like you around the office.
BRENNAN: No way.
DEREK: That's cool. That's cool with me. I don't care. It's amazing how little I care. Truth is I smoked a jay in the car about two minutes ago, so I'm a little spacey. (starts to rap) I GET SPACEY ... I'M ALL LACEY ... I GO TO MACEY'S WITH MY GIRL ... STACEY ... He stops and Brennan and Dale are just looking at him.
DEREK: You both wanna hit me don't you? I love it. Go ahead. Punch me right in the face. What? (MORE) 33. * DEREK (cont'd) Are you just going to sit there on your vaginas and do nothing? I'm asking you to punch me in the f-34. Dale punches Derek in the face hard. Derek falls from the tree fort a good ten feet and hits the ground hard.
DEREK: Ahhhh .... My shoulder ... ahhhh ... Brennan turns to Dale. He's amazed and impressed.
BRENNAN: That was awesome. EXT. DRIVEWAY Derek and the family are loading up in the car.
ROBERT: Derek I have to say, it was an absolute pleasure to finally get to meet you.
DEREK: The pleasure was all mine, Robert. CUT TO: Robert gives Derek a warm embrace that goes on little too long.
NANCY: All right Robert that's enough. Brennan is saying goodbye to the kids.
BRENNAN: How's your singing going Tiffany?
TIFFANY: Good. My friends and I like to sing to Christina Aguilera and dance around the room.
BRENNAN: She has a tough vocal range. Here, I got this for you. He hands her some sheet music.
BRENNAN: It's the sheet music for Elton John's "I'm Still Standing". Why don't you learn it and we can sing it together next time you come back.
TIFFANY: Thanks Uncle Brennan. 35. Dale stands by the front door watching everyone leaving when as if out of nowhere, Alice comes up to Dale and speaks very rapidly, in hushed tones, right into his face.
ALICE: Hello I'm Alice, Derek's wife, is it true that you struck Derek in the face and he fell from the tree house because that's the most incredible thing I've ever heard, I want you to know that tonight I'm going to pleasure myself to the image of you doing that to Derek, you have the most brave eyes, eyes like a lion, I just want to lie in your mane all day and yet you seem sad at the same time, you know there's this charge between us and I can picture us making love and growing old together and with Derek I never picture us growing old, but with you I picture us growing old and living in New England and learning how to refurbish antique boats and I write a spy novel, that's ridiculous, but here's the thing, I'm not wearing panties and here's my cell phone number and-DALE Hi, I'm- ........... Yeah ...... . Thank you ...... Oh my God ......................... . ...... No, stop- She kisses him on the lips and gives Dale her number and leaves hurriedly.
DEREK: Alice! Come on! The interstate becomes a knot in ten minutes!
ALICE: I'm coming honey! * * 36. She trots off to the car leaving Dale stunned and aroused. Brennan walks back up towards Dale.
BRENNAN: Hey Dale.
DALE: Huh?! What's going on?
DALE: Do you want to see something cool? If you do then be up· in our bedroom in five minutes. SMASH CUT TO: MUSIC CUE: "SEVEN NATION ARMY" - WHITE STRIPES INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER Close-up of an ornate samurai sword being unsheathed. We pull out to see Brennan holding the sword.
BRENNAN: Pretty fuckin' cool, huh?
DALE: Wow that is a fuckin' nice sword.
BRENNAN: I have to say when I met you, I never thought that we'd be on terms where I felt comfortable showing you my samurai sword. But thanks for sticking up for me with Derek.
DALE: No problem.
BRENNAN: You see that black smudge on the blade.
DALE: Yeah.
BRENNAN: That's Bill Cosby's fuckin' autograph.
DALE: Why do you have Bill Cosby's autograph on a martial arts weapon?
BRENNAN: Because I happened to bump into him and all I had on me was this samurai sword. And your not going to not, get Cosby's autograph. Right?
DALE: I would've done the exact same thing. Now do you want to see something fuckin' cool?
BRENNAN: Of course. 37. Dale reaches under his bed and flips up his mattress to reveal a cache of, literally, 500 fireworks. Roman candles, bottle rockets, cones, M-80's, everything.
DALE: Check it.
BRENNAN: Holy Santa Claus shit.
DALE: You know it. Once a year I borrow my dad's car, drive down to Mehico, stock up and then come July 4th, guess who's front yard every kid in the neighborhood wants to hang out in. Mine.
BRENNAN: I can't believe the first couple of days I'm living here, I'm walking around thinking I've got a dick for a step-brother. And secretly, you're cool as shit. Dale points to his face.
DALE: See this fuckin' thing right here? It's called a fuckin' poker face. ROBERT (O.C.) Will you please stop cursing so much up there. We can hear it through the vents.
DALE: Sorry dad! ROBERT (O.C.) We know you're trying to be tough in front of each other. But please give it a rest!
DALE: Alright!!
BRENNAN: Okay these fireworks are cool. But do you want to see something really, really cool?
DALE: I think it's been established pretty clearly that I like to see cool shit. I mean stuff. CLOSE-UP ON BLACK CASE 38. Brennan undoing latches and slowly lifts the top to reveal ...
BRENNAN: Check it out. Movie-quality Chewbacca mask. This is good enough that George Lucas signed a document saying that he would have used it in the first Star Wars.
DALE: Fuck yeah!
BRENNAN: The jaw actually moves.
DALE: Alright, alright, I've got a good one. Turn off the lights.
BRENNAN: Why?
DALE: Just turn em off. 39. Brennan turns off the lights. In the darkness we hear Dale say ...
DALE: Here put this on. We see through Brennan's POV that he's looking through night vision goggles. Dale has them on as well.
DALE: Night fuckin vision goggles.
BRENNAN: Oh my god I just came! Can you imagine if we had these when we were twelve.
DALE: Guess what, it's even better. We got these when we were forty.
BRENNAN: Alright I'm turning on the lights cause I have the best thing ever. Brennan turns on the lights, scrambles under his bed and pulls out a poster tube.
BRENNAN: Mint condition and I'm talking mint: Nelly Furtado concert poster. Dale is not saying anything.
BRENNAN: What's wrong?
DALE: That's not quite as cool as the other things.
BRENNAN: Yeah you're right. I guess I'm out of cool stuff.
DALE: Well I'm not, check this out. Dale takes the lid of big plastic container. He starts stacking plastic cup on the dresser. *
DALE: Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, I got the other guy, I got the colonel. That's right, the entire Burger King Armageddon collectible cup series. Except for one. Beat. Brennan looks at him.
DALE: Not cool either, right? Well then I'm out of cool stuff too. Oh wait, no I'm not! Does a big, ceramic boot full of pennies sound cool?
BRENNAN: No not cool.
DALE: Ok, I'm definitely done. Hey I've got an idea, let's go down to the kitchen and make a big, ice cream creation.
BRENNAN: Yeah, cool.
DALE: Let's go. They both tear out of the room and run down the stairs. 40. MUSIC CUE: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" - HALL AND OATES
CU OF FEET RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS: INT. KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER Dale and Brennan throw nuts, cherries, whip cream and a ton of ice cream into a bowl with peanut butter and graded cheese. They both laugh when they put the cheese on.
CU OF FEET RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS: Robert and Nancy are in bed, hearing the footsteps.
ROBERT: What's going on? * * 41. INT. LIVING ROOM -TWENTY MINUTES LATER Brennan is holding a board and Dale breaks it with his foot. Brennan then takes a shot at a board and breaks it with his head. They both react very excitedly.
CU OF FEET RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS: Back to Robert and Nancy in bed.
NANCY: I think they're starting to like each other. INT. BATHROOM -TWENTY MINUTES LATER Dale and Brennan are both in the bathroom with a tape measure, measuring penis size and holding up the results.
CU OF FEET RUNNING ACROSS THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR: They sit and watch "Over the Top" with Sylvester Stallone. * Sly pins his opponent in the championship arm wrestle, the guys pump their fists like idiots while they eat their ice cream creation. INT. ROBERT AND NANCY'S BEDROOM The door flies open, Brennan and Dale nervously stand in the doorway.
ROBERT: Guys what the hell is going on?
BRENNAN: Mom? Mr. Dobak? Dale and I were just wondering-
ROBERT: Please stop calling me Mr. Dobak.
BRENNAN: Ok. Mom? Dobak? Dale and I have been thinking that it would be prudent to-*
DALE: (interrupting) Can we turn our beds into bunkbeds??!!!
NANCY: Why are you guys so sweaty?
DALE: Please say yes. We've already figured out how to do this. The beds match up perfectly.
BRENNAN: It would give us more space in our room, to do activities.
DALE: Please say yes!
ROBERT: You don't need permission from us to build bunk beds. You're grown men. You can do what you want. They stand there staring at them.
NANCY: Yes, you can turn your beds into bunk beds.
DALE: Yes, I knew it!!
BRENNAN: Sweet! Mom, Mr. Dobak, you're not going to regret this! You're going to see, we're going to get so many activities done!
DALE: This is the funnest night ever!
BRENNAN: I'm so glad we moved in here. They bolt out of the room. HALL AND OATES, KICKS BACK IN 42. CUT TO: 43. INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM Quick cuts of (1) Dale and Brennan lifting the beds together, (2) they harrrrner the posts together, (3) they both jump on the top bunk which irrrrnediately splinters and breaks, they fall to the ground.

BRENNAN: Mom! Mom! Mom! INT. ROBERT AND NANCY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Dale comes running in.
DALE: Dad! Nancy! It's bad. It's so fucking bad. There's blood everywhere! The bunk beds were a terrible idea. It's so fucking bad! INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER Robert, Nancy and Dale come running back into the bedroom. Brennan is thrashing around on the floor.
BRENNAN: Ahhhh! My arm!! It hurts so bad! I don't wanna lose my a=! It hit a main artery!! I'm certain!! Ahahahah! ! Robert and Nancy just stand there.
DALE: Do something! Do something! Slowly Brennan stops thrashing and everyone is silent. Brennan and Dale are both just breathing kind of hard. *
ROBERT: (very calm) Brennan is it okay if I look at your arm?
BRENNAN: Yeah, okay.
ROBERT: How would you describe that Brennan?
BRENNAN: Not so bad.
ROBERT: Okay you know what I think happened? You both had close to two gallons of ice cream. You did a lot of running around. Dale did you guys watch Over the Top?
DALE: Yes.
ROBERT: How many times?
DALE: Twice.
ROBERT: See where this is going?
DALE: Yeah.
ROBERT: You guys just got over-excited. Now why don't we clean this mess up and we can all go to bed.
NANCY: Does that sound okay?
DALE AND BRENNAN: Yes. 44. CUT TO: INT. ROBERT AND NANCY'S BEDROOM Robert and Nancy are going back to bed.
NANCY: Well the good news is, it looks like they're becoming friends. What do you think Robert?
ROBERT: Honestly, I'm really fucking tired of talking about them.
NANCY: What has gotten into you?
ROBERT: I'm just sick of everything being about our two grown sons. We were supposed to have sex tonight and instead we're talking about Dale and Brennan!
NANCY: Fine. If that's what you want, let's just stop talking and have sex. Come on then!
ROBERT: That's really fucking romantic Nancy. Forget it. I'm going to sleep. If I'm lucky maybe I'll have a wet dream to Reba McIntyre! 45. * * * * * * * * * Robert rolls over. *
NANCY: You can be really nasty. Do you know that? INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM - 4 AM Both the boys are sleeping extremely hard. After a beat, Brennan slowly gets up, walks out the door. Then Dale gets up, walks out the door. MUSIC CUE: CHIMEY VIBES * * 46. INT. ROBERT'S AUDI - FIVE MINUTES LATER They guys are "sleep driving" a car. We see it's going really slow and hugging the side of the road. They pull into a convenience store, park the car sideways across three spaces. CUT TO: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - CONTINUOUS We see from the security cam: The store is empty, except for a DOMINICAN CLERK, 23, behind the counter. Dale and Brennan march in like zombies. Brennan "sleep" reads some magazines, kinda of making a mess of them. Dale makes a bee-line for the refrigerated case.
CLERK: Hey man, are you in your underwear? Dale opens a carton of milk and starts to chug it, most of the milk spills down the front of his pajamas.
CLERK: Hey, no, no, no, no. We don't do that. Clerk starts walking over to him. Brennan is putting stuff into the microwave. Dale then starts ripping into cheese packs. The clerk tries to grab him and Dale pounds on him, like some weird robot-machine. Immediately Brennan runs over to Dale's defense, in doing so, Brennan pushes over a whole aisle of stuff. The clerk fights back a little beat, but is beaten down by both guys. The guys make a dash for the front of the store, grabbing bags of chips, ripping them open and half eating the contents. INT. CAR - TEN MINUTES LATER The guys are driving home but we see that now they're just cutting across the front lawns of the neighborhood houses. Driving over front lawn after front lawn, fences, hedges, parallel to the road. They "sleep sing" to a song on the radio,"Two Tickets to Paradise" by Eddie Money.
DALE AND BRENNAN: Twahh taggss tahh paaadaaa ... dah gah .... CUT TO: 47. EXT. HOUSE - SUN COMING UP Pan down to see Robert's Audi, mud caked on the tires, shrubs sticking out of it, as it is parked across the front lawn. INT. KITCHEN - A FEW HOURS LATER Nancy is making eggs. Dale and Brennan are seated at the kitchen table while Robert pours a cup of coffee. The tiny kitchen TV is on in the background playing the local news. TV ANCHOR (SOT) .... authorities are calling the convenience store assailants the "zombie attackers" because of their drugged out demeanor. If you have any info=ation on these men please ... We see grainy security cam footage of Dale and Brennan attacking the Clerk but it's impossible to make them out.
DALE: I feel so rested. Mom can I have some milk?
BRENNAN: That was a great night's sleep. And Mr. Dobak it turned out my arm healed up nicely.
ROBERT: We determined that last night.
NANCY: So what are your plans for today?
BRENNAN: We thought we'd play around with Dale's drum set and DJ equipment and then make some cheese steaks and then take a nap and then watch Jim Rome on ESPN and then, since we're all adults here, I was going to spend some time in the tree fort with the Playboys and my body .. Robert puts pieces of paper in front of Dale and Robert.
ROBERT: Actually I've got your day right here. Dale you've got five job interviews with three financial houses, a muffler shop and a party planning business.
DALE: What the hell is this?
ROBERT: And Brennan, you have four job interviews. One of them is for an assistant manager position at a Best Buy and another is an entry level job at a respected Sporting Goods supplier.
BRENNAN: Your not my real Dad!
NANCY: Brennan, he's trying to help.
ROBERT: Now you both listen to me. You now have less than eight weeks to find jobs and then you are out of here. So go put on suits and act like adults and get a damn job! They're silent. Slowly Brennan starts to cry.
ROBERT: Okay ... easy Brennan ...
BRENNAN: I'm alright .. I'm alright ... it's just a lot and you kinda raised your voice.
DALE: I'm used to you dad, but you do come off harsh.
NANCY: There is a better way to do this Robert.
ROBERT: Aw Jesus. I'm sorry Brennan. 48. * * CUT TO: 49. INT. OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY BOSS sits behind desk. Dale and Brennan sit across from him in tuxedos.
BOSS: Apparently there's been a misunderstanding. We're only looking to fill one position. Why are there two of you?
DALE: As you are probably well aware, market research is showing this new trend in corporate America in which companies are now hiring two people for one position.
BOSS: I've never heard anything remotely close to that.
DALE: Look if you want to look at the data, we brought plenty of documents.
BOSS: I'd love too.
DALE: Great let me get it for you. Everyone sits and stares at each other. Finally Dale starts to rummage in his briefcase.
DALE: Oh it's here somewhere. Found it. Dale reaches out of the briefcase and gives the guy a middle finger. Dale quickly runs out of the office, leaving Brennan just sitting there.
DALE: Let's book! Beat as Brennan just sits there.
BRENNAN: So I went to six colleges over the course of three years. (MORE) * BRENNAN (cont'd) I'm pretty good with people. I speak a little bit of Spanish.
BOSS: Why don't you just leave. INT. ANOTHER OFFICE -AN HOUR LATER 50. A HUMAN RESOURCES WOMAN is interviewing the guys, but now Dale is seated behind Brennan.
HR WOMAN: Well Brennan, you've certainly had a lot of jobs.
BRENNAN: Well Human Resources lady-
HR WOMAN: It's Pam. And in future interviews you should try to remember the name of the person who is conducting the interview.
BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Ok, Pan what I'm all about is-
HR WOMAN: It's Pam.
BRENNAN: Are you saying Pan or Pam?
HR WOMAN: Pam. And who is this gentleman sitting behind you?
DALE: Excuse, Ms. Lady. I'm Dale, Brennan's step-brother. I'm here for moral support and if there happened to be another position opening up, I am available.
HR WOMAN: There isn't another position available.
DALE: Also if I can step in and maybe moderate this Pam/Pan confusion. What is your last name, please?
HR WOMAN: Gringe.
BRENNAN: Really? Your name is Pan Gringe?
HR WOMAN: Please get out of my office. We're done with this interview. INT. ANOTHER OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER 51. This time Dale is seated in front, Brennan stands behind him. They are talking to GUY, in suspenders and tie.
GUY: It says here you graduated from Cal State Bakersfield with a degree in business administration and then there is a long gap in your employment history. And your only reference is from a "Pan Gringe" which you've hand written on the resume.
DALE: What do you say we turn the tables here a little bit and I, interview, you?
GUY: Ok, that is sometimes a useful exercise. Fire away.
DALE: What college, if any, did you go to?
GUY: I actually graduated from Washington State and I got my master's from UCLA.
DALE: How do I know you're not lying?
GUY: Both degrees are hanging right there on the wall.
BRENNAN: Those could be forgeries. * * * *
GUY: Well they're not.
DALE: Have you ever smoked crack cocaine?
GUY: No. I have not.
DALE: How much was your salary last year?
GUY: I'm not comfortable answering that.
DALE: I see this is going to be a difficult interview. Brennan any questions?
BRENNAN: Yeah. One big one off the top of my head, where'd you get the big, fat, giant attitude? Cause it is wearin' thin!
GUY: Ok guys. I think that's it.
DALE: Well I don't know how you're end of the interview went. But from our end, we were not impressed.
GUY: You know at first I got a kick out of you guys, but now I need you to just get out!! Get out!!! INT. SPORTING GOODS OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER 52. A MANAGER, 51, of a Sporting Goods chain is seated across from Brennan and Dale reading their resumes.
MANAGER: I can't believe I'm about to say this but it turns out we've got two positions available and I must say I'm getting a kick out of the tuxedos, you guys seem like you have a lot of energy, little short on experience but sometimes you just need to roll the dice. So with that, I want to say welcome-53. At that moment the longest, high pitched fart you have ever heard, is unleashed.
DALE: (whispering) I'm sorry. I thought it was going to be silent. The manager just stares at them.
BRENNAN: Should we go?
MANAGER: I think that would be best. EXT. STREET CUT TO: Dale and Brennan get off the bus, they're tuxedos are now rumpled. Dale unlocks his bike that was chained to a stop sign. He gets on and slowly pedals next to Brennan, who just walks.
DALE: Today doesn't surprise me. We're not nine-to-five guys. Do you think Einstein ever turned in a resume? Hell no!
BRENNAN: God we were so close. Why did you have to fart?
DALE: That fart may have been the best thing that ever happened to us! Besides I really couldn't hold it and I thought it was going to be silent. Dale pedals for a beat.
DALE: Brennan what are you really good at?
BRENNAN: Singing. I'm a world class singer.
DALE: How good is that.
BRENNAN: I'm probably one of the top three hundred singers in the world.
DALE: See! Right there! That's an amazing skill. Now what am I good at? I can shred on the drums. I'm a top notch DJ and I'm a marketing whiz. So put all that together and what do you have?
BRENNAN: Urn I don't know.
DALE: Wait what time is it?
BRENNAN: 4:30
DALE: Oh, we shouldn't go down Whitworth.
BRENNAN: Why, it's the quickest way home.
DALE: Alright there's this guy Chris Gardoki, he's 13, he's an eighth grader at Lane Tree middle school. He's been in my face a couple of times. I just don't want the hassle. Let's go the long way.
BRENNAN: I'm not going down Cutler. That's like an hour longer. Did you say he's 13? 54. * *
DALE: Yeah. Let's go down Cutler.
BRENNAN: No, he's a kid! We'll be fine.
DALE: Oh man ... EXT. LANE TREE MIDDLE SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER 55. They now have walked to a section of the street that has a park/schoolyard, where 50 kids are hanging out. Brennan and Dale come strolling by.
DALE: I don't know about this. CHRIS GARDOKI, a big 13-year-old, is doing pull-ups on the monkey bars wearing a Polo, short sleeve shirt. An odd­ looking RED HEAD kid, steps into frame.
RED HEADED KID: Hey Chris. Fag alert ten o'clock. Chris swings off the bars and lands next to the kid.
CHRIS: Oh my god. Is that Dale Dobak? Let's make him eat dogshit.
RED HEADED KID: Yeah. All the kids start making ape sounds, jumping up and down. Chris starts punching the air like a boxer. Dale stops in his tracks.
BRENNAN: Dale what are you doing? They're kids. This is a public street. We are going to walk down it. Chris and the whole pack of kids start walking towards them.
CHRIS: Hey fagstick. Long time no see. Is that your boyfriend? Is that your butt buddy? Did you guys just come from doing it? Answer me!
DALE: No he's not my butt buddy! We just came from job interviews. Now leave us alone!
CHRIS: Does butt buddy have a name?
BRENNAN: My name is Brennan Huff and as a younger person, you should show me, an adult, some respect.
RED HEADED KID: Hey how's this for respect? You come over here in your faggy tuxedo and lick this white dogshit or I'm gonna plow into your nose with my fist!
BRENNAN: Look I'm twice your size and there is no way that I'm licking dogshit.
DALE: I'll lick the dogshit if you leave him alone.
BRENNAN: Dale! You're not licking dogshit! This is ridiculous! These are kids! 56. Before we have any idea what's going on, the red-headed kid punches Brennan right in the nose.
BRENNAN: Ahhh! My nose!!! Three other kids jump on Brennan. All making ape noises. Chris Gardoki goes after Dale with a karate kick. The kids circle around as Dale and Brennan fight the kids. It's a pretty even match. CUT TO: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, LANE TREE MIDDLE SCHOOL - TWENTY
MINUTES LATER: Dale, Brennan, Chris Gardoki and the red-headed kid sit across from the PRINCIPAL. Dale has a black eye. Brennan has a bloody nose.
PRINCIPAL: Here at Lane Tree we believe that our students should uphold a certain degree and standard of conduct. So when I witnessed the type of behavior that took place today .. I'm sorry who are you two?
DALE: I'm Dale Dobak, sir.
BRENNAN: Brennan Huff.
PRINCIPAL: How old are you?
DALE: I'm 40.
BRENNAN: I'm 39. And as for proper conduct, I'd like to point out that Chris Gardoki over here said that my mom must have a "fag-gina", cause all that ever came out of it was fags like me.
PRINCIPAL: (to Brennan) Watch the language young man or sir. Now I want you both off the school grounds immediately. Do you have a means of transportation?
DALE: No the kids took apart my bike and threw it up on the roof. Chris Gardoki and the red-headed kid high five.
PRINCIPAL: Alright, then I'm calling your parents. INT. NANCY'S CAR Dale and Brennan are in the back seat. 57. CUT TO: * * * * * * *
NANCY: So maybe you don't go down that way anymore. You know, maybe you take the long way home.
BRENNAN: That's what I think we're going to do, is take the long way home.
DALE: How mad is dad?
NANCY: He's pretty mad. He's mad that you took his tuxedos. He's mad about the interviews. I guess one of the people you talked to was a friend of his and said something about a big fart or something. I'm sure they were exaggerating. He's also not so happy about getting a call from a junior high principal. Think about it. All that stuff kinda adds up.
DALE: Nancy we did nothing wrong.
BRENNAN: Can we get pizza tonight?
NANCY: I was actually going to cook a piece of fish.
BRENNAN: Maybe Dale and I will get pizza.
NANCY: So Robert and I were talking and maybe both of you should be talking to someone professionally.
BRENNAN: What are talking about?
NANCY: You know, a therapist.
DALE: No-no-no-no, uh-uh. I'm not letting those psychos into my head. (MORE) 58. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * DALE (cont'd) Did you see what they did to Michael Jackson? They only way I'll do it, is for a hundred dollars.
NANCY: Well I'm afraid this is non­ negotiable. You've got less than two months to find jobs and frankly I think you should take any help you can get.
BRENNAN: This is fucked up!!
NANCY: Brennan! Where did you learn to talk like that?!
BRENNAN: From you! INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT CUT Dale and Brennan both lay in their beds staring at the ceiling.
DALE: With your talent and my brains it's the perfect idea.
BRENNAN: I love it. And it'll get Mom and Mr. Dobak off of our backs about getting jobs.
DALE: We'll need investors. Big investors.
BRENNAN: We can put together a whole presentation. Really blow them away. The money will pour in. Man, this idea just feels right.
DALE: But here's the thing, if we're going to start a huge multi­ national entertainment company, I'm going to have to hear you sing. 59. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * TO: *
BRENNAN: Can't you just trust me that I'm really good?
DALE: Just one song, so I know what kind of voice you have.
BRENNAN: Okay, fine. (clears throat) Wow, I'm just going to do this. Ahh Jesus, my heart is pounding. PEOPLE ARE TALKING, TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE I HEAR THEM WHISPER, YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT THEY THINK WE'RE LOVERS, KEPT UNDER
COVERS: I JUST IGNORE IT, BUT THEY KEEP SAYING
WE LAUGH JUST A LITTLE TOO LOUD: 
WE STAND JUST A LITTLE TOO CLOSE: 
WE STARE JUST A LITTLE TOO LONG: MAYBE THEY'RE SEEING SOMETHING WE DON'T DARLIN LET'S GIVE THEM SOMETHIN' TO TALK ABOUT LET'S GIVE THEM SOMETHIN' TO TALK ABOUT, HOW ABOUT LOVE, LOVE, LOVE OH-OH-OH COME ON SCOOBY BOP DO DOP
DIG IT: So anyway I don't know-I wasn't warmed up-I didn't want to wake up Robert and Nancy-I also don't have a back-up band-plus my throat's sore-plus other things-it's just something to get you in the ballpark-let me go again.
DALE: Okay. You gotta know, what I'm about to say, I'm not just some guy. I play drums. I make beats. You've got a gift from God. That's one of the three greatest voices I've ever heard. Brennan I can't even make eye contact with you right now.
BRENNAN: Seriously, do not fuck with me. Are you being serious? 60.
DALE: Brennan it's me, Dale. You're good, end of discussion. First thing tomorrow we should start working on our investor presentation. We're going to need the right event to really uncork this thing.
BRENNAN: It's crazy how right this feels.
DALE: And I will not rest until Chris Gardoki and that weird red-headed kid turn on the radio and hear our music and say, "We were wrong for trying to make them lick white dog shit cause their music is so cool that we can't handle it!"
BRENNAN: Amen step-brother. Amen. 61. They high-five. * CUT TO: * INT. DALE'S THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY * Dale is seated across from a male THERAPIST, 42. They are * quiet. Dale fidgets. * INT. BRENNAN'S THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY * Brennan is seated across from a female therapist DENISE, 35. * They are quiet. Brennan fidgets. * INT. DALE'S THERAPIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS * THERAPIST * So how are you doing today Dale? *
DALE: (super defensive) How are you doing today? * * * INT. BRENNAN'S THERAPIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
DENISE: Beat. So I thought we would start with talking about your parents divorce.
BRENNAN: Ok.
DENISE: How old were you?
BRENNAN: I was fifteen.
DENISE: That must have been very hard for you.
BRENNAN: I ... love you. INT. DALE'S THERAPIST - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
THERAPIST: Sure it's not been easy. I've been divorced. I have some unreconciled issues with my father. And those have led to some anger issues. I've been honest with you. Now will you be honest with me!
DALE: Oh my God! You are seriously messed up! Are you gay? INT. BRENNAN'S THERAPIST'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
DENISE: What feelings do you have about that time after your Father left.
BRENNAN: I just really, really want to kiss your neck right now. It's the prettiest neck I've ever seen. 62. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
DENISE: Mr. Huff please, I think you're experiencing a lot of emotions and you're confusing my compassion with love. It's very common with patients.
BRENNAN: I'm experiencing one feeling and that's the feeling you get when you look at a woman who's beauty is so exquisite that it makes you want to carve her image out of ice or wood. Preferably redwood. Using a chain saw.
DENISE: I think this session is over. EXT. SUBURBAN STEAKHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 63. CUT TO: We see a parking lot full of cars. It is a semi-upscale steak restaurant off of the highway, RJ Posner's Steak and Fine Dining. INT. BACK BANQUET ROOM - CONTINUOUS A big birthday celebration for Derek is taking place. We see a huge banner that say, uHappy B-day Derek, You're so Money!u, with helicopters on each side of it. Derek and his wife Alice are there, along with about a dozen guys from work, all in crisp white shirts and expensive ties. Robert and Nancy are there close to Derek. Dale and Brennan sit at the far end of the giant table, both are eating a lot of bread. Waitresses are bringing in platters of jumbo shrimp * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * and Caesar salads. Derek is opening a gift. *
DEREK: Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Calloway three­ wood. So I can bomb it down the fairway. Thanks TJ.
TJ: You Da Man Derek!!
NANCY: What were Dale and Brennan up too with my digital camera all day? * *
ROBERT: Some big project. I'm beginning to think they're really bad for each other.
NANCY: I don't agree. You know how they say, "three steps forward, two steps back"? Maybe they're in the two steps back phase?
ROBERT: I think you're fooling yourself.
NANCY: Don't ever talk to me like that, Robert. I am a grown woman and I am not "fooling" myself. Derek leans in.
DEREK: How's it going gang? Sounds like some marital discord. Robert if I can give you some advice, just say, "yes dear" to everything and plead the fifth. Robert and Derek laugh really hard.
NANCY: Fuck you Robert! 64. We are the cling-cling of knife against a glass and see Dale standing, as if to make a toast. Brennan is behind him setting up a slide projector.
DALE: If I can have your attention. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Dale Dobak. I'm Robert's son. Bear with me, I tend to speak a little fast and too loud, when I'm passionate about a subject!
DEREK: What are you doing? *
DALE: Please shut up! And I know it's your birthday, but Brennan and I just need seven minutes of your time for this exciting presentation. I have had the wait staff lock the doors to the banquet room, so that everyone in this room can have absolute focus. Brennan go! 65. Lights go out and a slide is shown on the wall with a crudely drawn logo that says, "PRESTIGE ENTERTAINMENT". We hear a bad synth beat playing on a boom box, Dale and Brennan both speak into mies.
BRENNAN: London .... Tokyo .... Zurich .... Denver .... Brussels ... Cairo .... Beijing .... Paris ..... Denver ... Slides progress: (in each photo the guys are deadly serious) * photo of Dale playing his drums with black gloves on and a headset; photo Dale and Brennan holding up champagne glasses in the backyard, both wear black t-shirts; photo of Brennan standing next to a poster of a tiger; photo of Dale and Brennan wearing sunglasses and posing next to Robert's Audi.
DALE: Prestige entertainment. The first word in entertainment. President of operations Dale Dobak. President of talent coordination Brennan Huff. Investors? Possibly you ... The whole room groans.
VOICE: Fuck that.
BRENNAN: Geneva ... Istanbul ... Hawaii ... Orlando. More slides come across. Photo of a question mark.
DALE: But what is Prestige Entertainment? Music. Photo of Brennan singing way too hard while Dale plays drums.
DALE: Event planning. Photo of Dale holding a tray with some glasses on it and Brennan pointing as to where to go.
DALE: Management. Photo of Dale and Brennan talking on cell phones, each wearing sunglasses.
DALE: Security. 66. Photo of Brennan with samurai sword, Dale with fireworks. Both striking aggressive poses in their bedroom.
DALE: Personal training and diet advisement. Photo of Dale lifting weights and Brennan holding a head of lettuce and a carrot to camera.
DALE: And finally celebrities. Photo is clearly taken off the tv of Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.
DALE: But what is the future? Photo of the word "FUTURE".
DALE: And the future is ...
DALE AND BRENNAN: UP TO YOU!!! Lights go up.
DALE: What we need you to do is open up your checkbooks and write a check for a minimum by-in of ten thousand dollars. Imagine if Coca-Cola came to your door, a hundred years ago and made the same offer. (MORE) DALE (cont'd) Alright, I see that no one is taking out their checkbooks. TAKE OUT YOUR CHECKBOOKS!!!
DEREK: You know what I think the freak show is over guys. 67. At that moment, the doors to the banquet room burst open. The MANAGER and some of the wait staff come in.
MANAGER: What's going on in here? I just had to break the locks to get in here. EXT. STEAKHOUSE PARKING LOT - FIVE MINUTES LATER
DALE: I can't tell how that went. What's was your sense?
BRENNAN: I thought it was good but I think the problem is people don't travel with their checkbooks.
DALE: Oh that's it! We've got to do credit cards.
BRENNAN: Oh man, it's late. I better call Denise. We've got a date Thursday at her office at 11am for an hour. CUT TO: Brennan walks back into the restaurant. Dale mutters to himself.
DALE: Credit cards ... Duh ... Alice, Derek's wife, walks right up to Dale.
ALICE: You were amazing! I want you to do what you did in that banquet room, inside of me!
DALE: Oh my god! * * * 68. She starts pushing him back into the hedge. She reaches down, undoes his pants and begins straddling him.
ALICE: Fuck me with the energy of Prestige Entertainment, I want you to know that if Derek were find out about this he would literally kill you, he killed a man in Salt Lake City that I had an affair with, he got off because he knew the sheriff-he always gets to know the sheriff or law enforcement of whatever city we're living in that way he has one free killing. They both reach climax, as a family walks by.
FATHER: What is going on over there?
ALICE: Mind your own business! My husband is choking. I was giving him the Heimlich.
DALE: That's right! I'm her husband and I'm choking. She's giving me the Heimlich. That's a lovely jacket! The family leaves.
ALICE: I have to get back inside, remember, Derek will kill you and get away with it, if he finds out. She scurries away. INT. ROBERT'S CAR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER CUT TO: Robert is driving, Nancy is in the passenger seat. The guys sit in the back. Dale is still in shock from his encounter with Alice.
ROBERT: Humiliating is what it was. Absolutely humiliating. (MORE) ROBERT (cont'd) Asking people to invest money at a birthday party?! I'm just glad Derek had the grace to handle it well and save the evening by purchasing everyone those classy RJ Posner's satin jackets.
NANCY: Honestly guys, we just wish you would talk to us about these ideas before you act on them. These are not good ideas. Soliciting people for money at a birthday party? Going to job interviews as a team? Fighting 13 year olds? Questionable ideas.
BRENNAN: You're a questionable idea!
ROBERT: Hey watch that mouth! (noticing Dale's quiet) Dale what's wrong?
DALE: What?
ROBERT: Why are you so quiet? We're talking about what happened at Derek's birthday party.
DALE: Oh, I think it went great. Alice said she thought it was fantastic.
NANCY: When were you talking to Alice?
DALE: What? No not Alice ... Alan. You know the guy with the beard and sunglasses.
ROBERT: There wasn't anyone with a beara and sunglasses at the party. I would have noticed someone like that.
DALE: Well it was someone. Look are you guys going to invest or not? (MORE) 69. DALE (cont'd) Because Brennan and I have a dream and a talent. The car is now pulling into the driveway of the house.
ROBERT: We're not investing one dime.
DALE: First you wouldn't let me join the family business and now this! 70. The conversation continues as they exit the car and walk to the front door.
ROBERT: I'm a fucking Doctor!! And this business idea of yours is half baked!
DALE: You don't get us! Because we're young and hip!
ROBERT: I hate to break it to you, but your both forty!
DALE: We're on the streets, day in and day out, putting in the man-hours needed, so that we have our finger on the pulse of what's going down!
ROBERT: You're on the streets? What are you talking about?
BRENNAN: You're a poser!
NANCY: Brennan!
ROBERT: I'm a poser!! I'm a poser!! I'm a doctor of medicine!!
BRENNAN: You dig around in people's dirty ears! We make beautiful music!! * * * * * 71. INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The conversation continues through the front door and into the living room.
NANCY: Brennan! Stop it!
ROBERT: This morning I put a hearing aid in a nine-year-old girls ear, so that she could hear for the first time! You clowns haven't produced one note of music! !
NANCY: Everyone please calm down!!
BRENNAN: You're full of shit Robert! And here's the thing, you better sit down right now and write us a check for ten thousand dollars to Prestige Entertainment! Or I'll shove a hearing aid up your ass so you can listen to the sound of your own shit!!
DALE: (not knowing what to do with the adrenaline) Awwww ! ! ! Alice! ! We hear Robert yells the loudest anyone has yelled in the entire movie.
ROBERT: THAT ... IS .. ITTTT!!
NANCY: Oh my lord!
ROBERT: YOU ARE GOING TO GET A SPANKING!! THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO!! AND I'M GOING TO DO IT!! Robert awkwardly grabs Brennan, who resists. He pulls him and then tackles him to the couch.
NANCY: Stop it! Stop it! * *
ROBERT: YOU ARE GETTING SPANKED TONIGHT!!
BRENNAN: Mommy! Mommy!
ROBERT: DALE YOU ARE NEXT! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!
DALE: Yes sir! Robert rights himself and begins spanking Brennan.
ROBERT: CERTAIN .. BEHAVIOR .. IS .. UNACCEPTABLE ... IS ... THAT ... UNDERSTOOD!!
BRENNAN: Yes!! Yes!! 72. Nancy tries to come over and pull Robert off of Brennan.
NANCY: Robert stop this!! Then Dale tries to pull Nancy off of Robert.
DALE: Don't you hurt my dad! You weird lady! Dale shoves Nancy off of Robert. Robert continues to spank Brennan. Nancy smashes a vase off of Dale's head.
DALE: Ow!! Oh my god, my head! My goddamn fucking head has opened up!
BRENNAN: What did you do to my ass!!
ROBERT: What did you do to my son!!???
NANCY: Ahhhhhhh! Fuck! I don't like to curse! * CUT TO: * 73. EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX -TWO DAYS LATER * Suburban office complex. * INT. BRENNAN'S THERAPIST'S OFFICE * Brennan is seated across from his therapist, Denise. There * are a dozen different bouquets of flowers in the room. Some * with balloons, some with stuffed animals... * DENISE * So is there anything going on in * your life right now that you'd like * to talk about? *
BRENNAN: Nope. I'm good. Did you get the flowers I sent?
DENISE: You know that I did, they're all around us right now. Now let's get back to the events of the other night ...
BRENNAN: Did you used to play field hockey?
DENISE: Yes. Why?
BRENNAN: Because you have very sexy, slightly athletic legs.
DENISE: Brennan let's be really clear about something. You and I, will never be in a relationship. Never.
BRENNAN: Why do you have a boyfriend?
DENISE: No. I mean, I'm not going to answer that. 
BRENNAN: Ok, so you don't. What if we did something like this, I give you foot rubs and make you dinner every night this week. And if at the end of the week, you do not have any feelings for me, I walk away for good.
DENISE: No, that's not going to happen.
BRENNAN: Ok fine. How about this? The next rainy day, we rent your three, all time favorite movies, make sangria and popcorn, and hold hands. Once again, end of the day, if you have no feelings, I leave.
DENISE: Well that actually sounds like a lot of fun but no.
BRENNAN: Why do you keep saying no?
DENISE: Here's why. Because the third sentence you said to me was "I love you". You don't even know who I am. You're in love with an idea. And that's off putting and it's not respectful and it's a way to avoid doing real work on yourself.
BRENNAN: You don't think I know who you are?
DENISE: No Brennan! I don't think you do!
BRENNAN: You Dr. Denise Breckstein. You're thirty-four years old and you work in suite 211 at the Gorshin Medical Plaza. When you first set-up your office you were really excited about it. But now it seems drab and depressing to you. You're tired of always being the stable one in the relationship. (MORE) 74. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * BRENNAN (cont'd) You want someone who will leave silly messages on your cell phone, for no reason. Someone who will hide your underwear to make you late for work. At the same time you don't want to have to be embarrassed about your snorting laugh or the fact that you're way, way too ticklish, or that you still love frosted-covered pop tarts. But most importantly you want someone who, for a change, will listen to all that you have to say. Long beat as she just stares at him.
DENISE: I don't like this. You have to go. This session is over.
BRENNAN: Ok I'll leave. And I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. However, if you're just faking it and secretly you're just really excited about what I said, then I think that would go against everything you talk about in here about expressing yourself. Beat. Then they both kiss furiously.
DENISE: Oh my God ... You are such a mess ... and you make me so hot ...
BRENNAN: I don't even have a checking account and I'm 39!
DENISE: Ohhh! ! !
BRENNAN: I haven't been to the dentist in eight years! ! Denise pulls away.
DENISE: Stop! These walls are thin. Come to my house tonight. Here's my number. 75. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 76. BRENNAN * You'll have to pick me up. I don't * have a car. * DENISE * You're driving me crazy! * She kisses him again. * DISSOLVE TO: * EXT. SUBURBAN STREET OF SACRAMENTO - NIGHT * MUSIC: WINTER WONDERLAND We pan past houses with elaborate Christmas lights up. It is Christmas time. Occasionally we see a close-up of a smiling lawn reindeer or a waving Santa Clause. It is a very cheery time. EXT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS We see Dale and Brennan's house. They have some Christmas lights up. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Nancy and Dale are hanging ornaments on the Christmas tree * while Robert reads a magazine on the couch. *
DALE: The tree looks great Mom. Really tasteful.
NANCY: Why thank you Dale. And I have to say, except for the time you stole money from my purse, you have been a joy these past few weeks. Brennan comes in eating a roll.
NANCY: Brennan did you get the message Denise called?
BRENNAN: Yup. She's taking me out to dinner for New Year's. * * * * * * * * * * *
ROBERT: Unbelievable.
NANCY: Brennan's always had lovely girlfriends. I have to say.
DALE: So Morn? Dad? Would it be cool if Dale and I were allowed to open one present each, since it is Christmas Eve?
BRENNAN: Oh yeah! Can we, please, please, please?
NANCY: I don't know. Robert what do you think?
ROBERT: I don't give a shit. You're grown men, it's up to you. You can open up every present under the tree if you want!
NANCY: I think what you're father is trying to say is that you can make your own choices.
DALE: So can we open one or not?
BRENNAN: It would just be so we would have something to play with tonight and then we would get tired and go to bed. Robert is just staring at them.
ROBERT: I don't think I'm being clear enough. I ... don't ... give ... a ... fuck. You are grown men. You can take all your presents, open them all up, and throw them in the damn sewer. And if you ask me to leave cookies for Santa Claus, I swear I'm gonna punch you in the mouth. 77. * * * * * * * * * * * Dale and Brennan just stare at him.
NANCY: Go ahead.
DALE AND BRENNAN: Yes! ! ! 78. They run over and tear into two presents like wild animals.
ROBERT: I'm going down to the Cheesecake Factory for a drink.
NANCY: Robert, it's Christmas Eve. Robert grabs his jacket and leaves.
DALE: Oh my God! Hulk hands that make a smashing sound when you punch!!
BRENNAN: A 100% rawhide wallet!! How come Dale got the Hulk Hands! That's bullshit! INT. NANCY AND ROBERT'S BEDROOM- MIDNIGHT CUT TO: Nancy is reading a book on Jackie Kennedy as Robert enters.
NANCY: You reek of cheesecake and scotch.
ROBERT: You know tonight down at the Cheesecake Factory is the happiest I've been in months.
NANCY: Then I feel very sorry for you.
ROBERT: I love you Nancy. But I think we have to face the fact that this isn't working.
NANCY: Well what are you suggesting? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Just then their bedroom door bursts open and Brennan stagger in, in their pajamas, clearly sleepwalking.
ROBERT: Oh sweet Jesus!
NANCY: It's alright, they're sleepwalking. The two guys stand in place, swaying and making odd as they seemingly "stare" at Robert and Nancy. Just they turn around and walk out of the room.
ROBERT: Boy that is weird! I will never get used to that.
NANCY: It is definitely disconcerting, but there is nothing you can really do about it. 79. and Dale noises, like that * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Suddenly Brennan comes back with a armful of presents and * tosses them on the bed. * ROBERT * What the hell?! * He's immediately followed by Dale who also has presents and * tosses them on the bed. * NANCY * Remember don't wake them. * The guys keep coming back with presents but they're now just * walking into the room and hurling them. * ROBERT * Are you sure we can't wake them? * NANCY * I'm telling you they could do real * harm to themselves or others if you * attempt to wake them! * ROBERT * It's just bizarre. * NANCY * I know it is. * We now see the front of the Christmas tree being forced * through the bedroom door. *
ROBERT: Jesus the Christmas tree!
NANCY: Ahhh!
ROBERT: Be quiet! 80. They both carry the Christmas tree into the room and throw it. They pause and have a "conversation"
DALE: Amrnbbbrrkkknik. Juhhnnm
BRENNAN: Ahhhsbssmmmmmrn!!
DALE: Gorphahiffkm! !
BRENNAN: No! They storm out, leaving the room littered with debris. Long beat.
ROBERT: I'll put the tree back. CUT TO: EXT. HOUSE - CHRISTMAS DAY It's late afternoon. Around 4pm. We see Derek's SUV in the driveway. MUSIC: HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING Robert, Nancy, Dale and Brennan are joined by Derek, Alice * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * and their two children for Christmas dinner. There is a big * turkey on the well appointed table and everyone is eating and talking. *
DEREK: So I told him, I don't care if you are A-Rod. This chopper leases for eight grand a day. Now go work on hitting your curve ball. Dude was dumb founded. Robert laughs hard.
ROBERT: That's too good ... too good!
BRENNAN: You didn't say that Derek.
DEREK: Shut up Brennan.
ALICE: If you'll excuse me I have to go in the other room to check my hair.
DEREK: You'll have to pardon my weird wife. 81. Alice leaves quickly. Dale looks at her plate and we see that she has shaped her food to read "Please meet me in the living room my love." Dale quickly messes it up.
DALE: I have to get some more gravy.
NANCY: There's gravy on the table.
DALE: Shush Nancy! I'm going to get bread. Dale goes through the kitchen door.
NANCY: What did I do to deserve that? INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS We follow Dale and he walk-runs through the kitchen and out the back door and around the front to the door and into the living room. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Instantly Alice pulls Dale up against her and they begin having sex against the wall with Alice's back to Dale and her dress hiked up. *
ALICE: I felt like I was waiting for years.
DALE: This has to stop. This is dangerous and frightening. INT. DINING ROOM --- SAME TIME The rest of the family is eating.
TOMMY: .. and Santa gave me the AbMaster 4000 and one thousand dollars in fresh minted fifty dollar bills.
ROBERT: That's quite a bit of money for a young man like yourself.
TOMMY: Or not a lot of money for a young man like myself, depending on how you look at it. 82. All of the sudden there is rhythmic banging against the wall.
NANCY: What's that sound? Suddenly the dining room door bursts open. It's Dale and Alice, they are still engaged in intercourse, but Dale is behind Alice and they are still relatively clothed. Alice is slightly hunched over and Dale has his hands on her shoulders. The kids have their backs to this.
DALE: -no not against the door! Oh hey!
NANCY: What are you guys doing?
DALE: Alice was trying to move an extra chair into the dining room and her back went out.
ALICE: Yes my back went out and Dale is trying to help me. *
NANCY: We don't need an extra chair. There are plenty of chairs.
ALICE: Mine wasn't comfortable. Ohhh!!! Beat as they stand there.
DALE: Anyway what's going on? What are you guys talking about?
ROBERT: Dammit Dale just sit down.
DALE: Ok, we'll just put the chair back. The awkwardly inch back out the door. They exit. DALE We'll be right back.
ROBERT: So Tiffany what did you get for Christmas? The bumping starts again.
TIFFANY: I got my navel pierced and lunch with Deborah Norville. DALE (O.C.) Watch out! Stay away from the door. Dale and Alice push through the door again.
DALE: Hey are you all still talking in here?
NANCY: Alice is your back still bothering you? Because I have some Doan's back pills.
ALICE: I'm fine, thank you Nancy. We're almost done moving this chair. 83. * * *
BRENNAN: I can help you if you want Dale?
DALE: No!!!
ALICE: Ohhh! !
DEREK: What is wrong with you?!
ALICE: We're great, I'll be right back. They leave again. INT. LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER They stop having sex. Alice gives Dale a check.
DALE: We've gotta stop this!!
ALICE: That was the most fantastic, wonderful thing ever! Here I got you a check for Prestige Entertainment, I got it directly out of Derek's personal account. INT. DINING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER 84. We see close-up of coffee dripping into a coffee maker. Pull out to see dessert has been served. The kids are in the other room playing with toys. Derek is in the middle of a story.
DEREK: Everyone at the office is tiptoeing around the subject, so I march right up to the guy and say, "Hey Derek Huff, nice to meet you, what do you want to be called? Colored, negro or black?" He says black, I say, there, done. A week later, I get a letter in the mail saying we're being sued and this black fellow has quit. Now I ask you, what did I do wrong?
NANCY: That's completely inappropriate Derek.
ROBERT: I don't know Nancy. It is really hard nowadays with all these labels.
NANCY: Well be that as it may, we have something we'd like to talk about.
ROBERT: Are you going to do this now?
NANCY: I think we should, everyone's here.
BRENNAN: Did you sneak out and get me Hulk hands?
NANCY: No Brennan, I didn't get you fuckin' Hulk hands!!!!
DALE: What's going on?
ROBERT: Nancy and I have been talking. Things have been pretty rough between us, I know we hide it well. We've just come to a decision that at this point in our lives, we can't keep living like this.
NANCY: What Robert is trying to say is that we're getting a divorce. Everyone just looks at each other. Brennan and Dale both begin to sob.
BRENNAN: Don't do this!
DALE: No!! No!! 85.
DEREK: You know what, it's what you have to do. Ask Alice, I called this a week ago.
BRENNAN: Why!! Why is this happening??
DALE AND BRENNAN: Was it us?! It's our fault! We did this!!
NANCY: That's the main thing Robert and I talked about. We don't want you two to feel like you're to blame.
DALE: What can we do to fix it!?
ALICE: Dale, honey? Are you alright?
DEREK: Why are you calling him honey?
NANCY: I can't stress this enough. It's not your fault!
ROBERT: Ah the hell with this! It is your fault. It's directly your fault! The reason we're breaking up is because of you two dip shits!! Brennan and Dale explode with wailing.
DALE AND BRENNAN: Ahhh ! ! Ohhh ! ! Mommy! ! Daddy! !
DEREK: Yikes, this is gruesome.
ROBERT: Alright here is what's happening. We're moving out and putting the house up for sale. However long it takes to sell it, that's your time to find an apartment and jobs. I'm moving in with my friend Jack Handle. Nancy found a townhouse in the city. And that's that. 86.
DEREK: You know Robert, I've got my real estate license, I could sell this place for you at two-thirds commission.
ROBERT: Well that makes it real easy. Thank you Derek. 87. The boys sob as Nancy starts clearing the table and slowly everyone goes to the living room. MUSIC CUE: GREEN DAY "PARADISE"
MONTAGE: l)For sale sign being put on the front lawn with a smiling picture of Derek Huff on it. 2) movers come in and move all the furniture out. 3) Nancy hugging Dale and Brennan good-bye, then driving off. 4) Robert hugging Dale and Brennan good bye, then driving off. 5) Chris Gardoki and the weird Redhead ride by on their bikes, Dale and Brennan run into the house. 6) Shots of several rooms that are empty, except for folding lawn chairs. 7) Last shot is their room packed with stuff, in the center is a fort made from a blanket with a flashlight on inside. We push on inside. INT. BLANKET FORT - CONTINUOUS They do the entire scene with a flashlight lighting up their faces.
DALE: It's just you and me bro. And then there were two.
BRENNAN: I'm so scared Dale. What are we going to do? What are we going to do!!?? *
DALE: Shhh. One thing I know for sure is we are not going to leave this house. This is !!lY house! You know what they say in football when a home team defends it's field? "Not in my house!"
BRENNAN: So we don't leave this house. We make sure Derek can't sell it?
DALE: Exactly.
BRENNAN: What about Chris Gardoki and the weird redheaded kid? I don't want to lick white dog crap! I don't want to do it!
DALE: That may happen at some point, but right now we gotta strap it down and go into Rambo-ninja-mode! Now say it with me! Not in my house!
BRENNAN: Not in my house!
DALE: No you put the emphasis on the wrong word. Not in my house!
BRENNAN: Not in my house!
DALE: Just say the whole thing strong. Not in my house!
BRENNAN: I don't think I get it. I mean I get the whole concept of what you're saying, I just can't say the phrase right.
DALE: Ok that's fine. So we refuse to leave the house. And then, most importantly, we've got to get mom and dad back together. 88. * *
BRENNAN: What do we do for money?
DALE: That's taken care of. Dale hands Brennan Alice's crumpled check.
DALE: Alice came through for Prestige Entertainment with a check for ten grand.
BRENNAN: Holy shit!
DALE: So we can use this for food and supplies and other essentials. And to bank roll our master plan.
BRENNAN: We're gonna be okay.
DALE: Damn right we're going to be okay. Not in my house!
BRENNAN: No! Not there! In that place! 89. * CUT TO: * EXT. HOUSE - TWO DAYS LATER * Derek is showing the house to a young couple, KATHY, 28 and * JIM, 28. They walk up to the front door. * DEREK * As you can see you got a nice big * front lawn, beautiful colonial * entry and great neighborhood. Let * me just get this door open. * KATHY * It's beautiful. What do you think * Jim? *
JIM: It is really nice. I'm getting a good feeling from this one, Kathy. * * * 90. They enter into the house and find Dale there, cradling * Brennan, wrapped up in a shower curtain, holding himself as * stiff as a board, as if he's a dead body. *
DALE: Can't you people give me some privacy!! He just died last night!!
KATHY: Oh my god!!
JIM: We are so sorry They run out of the house. Derek just stands there. Dale and Brennan stand up.
DEREK: You fuckers just cost me a sale.
BRENNAN: That was the whole idea, now wasn't it Derek? Derek turns and stands in the doorway.
DEREK: I'm going to have to take this up a notch. He closes the door and leaves.
DALE: We're going to have to get mom and dad back together fast. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CUT TO: * EXT. STREET - DAY * Brennan and Dale stand on the street across from Nancy's * office building.

INT. NANCY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS The phone rings in Nancy's office. She picks it up.
NANCY: Hello, Nancy Huff speaking. DALE (O.C.) (doing a mild impression of Robert) Hello Nancy. It's Robert.
NANCY: Hello Robert? This connection is terrible. I can barely hear you. EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 91. Brennan is right up against Dale's head so he can hear. We cut back and forth throughout the conversation.
DALE: It doesn't matter. Because the real connection I want is between us.
NANCY: What?
DALE: I miss you sweetie. I miss the way you touch me.
BRENNAN: (whispering) Hey! That's my Mother!
DALE: (whispering back to Brennan) This is how married couples talk.
NANCY: Who is this?
DALE: It's Robert. And we made a mistake breaking up. I'm so hard right now. Will you stroke my shaft? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
BRENNAN: Fucking stop it!
NANCY: Brennan? Dale hangs up.
BRENNAN: You just asked my Mom to stroke your shaft!
DALE: Grow the hell up! I'm sure your Mom stroked my Dad's shaft a hundred times.
BRENNAN: Nooooo! ! ! Brennan tackles Dale on the street and they fight. 92. Nancy watches from her office window shaking her head sadly.
DALE: Shit! She can see us!
BRENNAN: Book! They run down the street. Nancy is now on the phone.
NANCY: They just called me pretending to be you ... I know ... I bet you they haven't even left the house yet ... EXT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S HOUSE -THREE DAYS LATER CUT TO: We see Denise in her Honda pulling up to the house. She gets out and walks up to the front door. She knocks and Brennan steps out closing the door behind him.
BRENNAN: Oh my God, I'm so glad you came! He gives her a kiss. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
DENISE: Brennan where have you been? You haven't called in a week.
BRENNAN: I was scared.
DENISE: Why were you scared?
BRENNAN: Because I think part of the reason you spend time with me is because I'm messed up.
DENISE: Of course. I've been nothing but up front about that.
BRENNAN: Well now I'm taking care of myself. I'm living in my own home and things are going really well. And I guess I thought you wouldn't want to be around me anymore.
DENISE: Brennan, I want nothing but the best for you. If you're doing well that makes me happy. 93. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * BRENNAN * Oh thank God. I was worried I was * doing too well. . . * DENISE * Don't worry. Now can I see your * place? I'm excited for you. * INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS * Denise walks into the house to find that it is a wreck. There * are literally stacks of a hundred Domino's pizza boxes * everywhere in the living room, a flat screen TV with hash on * it, dirty clothes and a couple of For Sale signs laying on * the floor. In the dining room a batting cage has been set up * and Dale is in it naked and taking cuts. * DALE * Hey! Brennan was right! You are * hot! *
DENISE: (in shock) Oh my God ... Brennan lights up a cigarette.
BRENNAN: I took up smoking. Doesn't it make me look cool?
DENISE: Why are there so many empty pizza boxes?
BRENNAN: Most of the boxes are full. We just ordered this many so we didn't have to keep calling. Dale walks over, still naked, holding a piece a pizza.
DALE: Hey Brennan? I figured it out. We can clean our clothes in the neighbors' pool at night.
BRENNAN: Denise this is my stepbrother Dale.
DALE: Hey nice to meet you. Look I can put a robe or towel on if you're uncomfortable but if you're fine with it, I'm definitely cool with it.
DENISE: I should go ... I'm going to leave ... She walks out the front door. Brennan follows.
DENISE: I am such an idiot ... I'm such a fucking idiot ...
BRENNAN: What's going on? 94. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
DENISE: Brennan, someday you're going to take a leap and I'll be very excited to talk to that person that you become. But until that point, I can't see you anymore. I'm sorry. Denise gets into her car and drives off.
BRENNAN: Denise! Denise!! Dale comes walking out naked.
DALE: Let her go bro.
BRENNAN: Maybe we should just leave the house and go get jobs ...
DALE: Hey! Hey! We have got to stay focused! Once we get Mom and Dad back together everything will go back to being the way it was.
BRENNAN: Really?
DALE: Of course. Now say it ...
BRENNAN: (fired up again) Not in the house!! INT. NANCY'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY MUSIC: PLUCKY STRINGS 95. CUT TO: Nancy is walking down the hallway of her office talking to a CO-WORKER.
NANCY: If the Doctors are complaining about the size of the sample stands then just leave the samples without the stands. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Her Assistant runs up to her.
ASSISTANT: Nancy, Francine wants to meet you for dinner tonight at Georgio's to discuss the new Renomax line.
NANCY: Ahh Francine drives me nuts! We talked for three hours yesterday about that.
ASSISTANT: I expressed that, Nancy but she wants to meet for dinner.
NANCY: Okay, fine then.
ASSISTANT: She's a real bitch, isn't she?
NANCY: Hey that's not professional.
ASSISTANT: I'm sorry, I thought we were speaking freely. INT. ROBERT'S EXAMINING ROOM -THAT SAME DAY Robert is performing a hearing test on a patient.
ROBERT: Is that louder or softer? Sir? Sir? Robert's Receptionist peaks in the door.
RECEPTIONIST: Dr. Doback? Am I interrupting?
ROBERT: No I don't think he can hear me at all.
RECEPTIONIST: Dr. Kalane called and wants to meet you for dinner tonight. He said it's about you heading the department at the University Hospital. 96.
ROBERT: Really?
RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry to interrupt.
ROBERT: No, you're not interrupting at all, that's huge news. Plus, I think Mr. Devlin is suffering from total hearing loss. The receptionist leaves and Robert turns to the patient.
ROBERT: Hey! Hey! Horse cock! ... I shouldn't do that ... INT. BRENNAN AND DALE'S LIVING ROOM - THAT DAY 97. Brennan and Dale are there with two neighbors. MRS. LAWSON, 71 and MR. WEEDLE, 81. Dale is handing them boxes of old pizza as payment. MRS. LAWSON Well you were right Dale. Talking on the phone and doing make believe voices was a lot of fun. MR. WEEDLE I just don't understand why this Dr. Kalane couldn't call your father himself.
DALE: Well he just couldn't and the part is you get pizza to take MRS. LAWSON Hmrnm fresh pizza.
BRENNAN: No it's not Mrs. Lawson.
DALE: Shhhh! ! ! MR. WEEDLE best home. It was fun to do funny voices, I think my friend Carol would get a kick out of it. Do you know Carol? (MORE) MR. WEEDLE (cont'd) Carol Mongh? She's on the local news.
DALE: Oh is she your neighbor? MR. WEEDLE No, she's on the news. She does the four o'clock and the six o'clock news. I talk to her every night, on the tv.
DALE: Oh, well thanks for helping us. MR. WEEDLE She's wonderful. She's smart, funny, has a real twinkle in her eye. She's a nip. I don't know what the terms are these days. She's from Vietnam.
BRENNAN: She's Vietnamese. MR. WEEDLE No, that doesn't sound right. She's a nip. Anyway, my son Nathan and his family moved to Dallas and she's my best friend. (secretly) I even snuck a kiss in the other night.
DALE: So you kissed the television set. MR. WEEDLE No, I kissed her. On the lips. Oh I've said too much.
BRENNAN: I think I'm going to cry.
DALE: Well thanks again. Why don't you guys head home. MRS. LAWSON Last week I fell down in my kitchen and I didn't get up for two days. My cat licked my face and I pretended to be a baby. 98. * * * *
BRENNAN: This was a bad idea.
DALE: Shut up Brennan. We'll see you guys later, have a nice evening. He ushers them out the door.
BRENNAN: Now I feel really sad.
DALE: Dude our plan is working! Mom and dad are going to have dinner tonight! Don't go all soft on me. Now let's go wash our clothes in the pool, eat some pizza and take a few cuts in the batting cage to get ready. EXT. GEORGIO'S RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT 99. DISSOLVE TO: We see a quaint Italian restaurant in downtown Sacramento. INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS Robert walks into the restaurant and goes up to the HOSTESS.
ROBERT: Hello, Dr. Robert Doback. I'm here for dinner with Dr. Kalane.
HOSTESS: Let me check ... She looks at her reservation list and then smiles slyly.
HOSTESS: Oh yes, I see it's a very special evening for you.
ROBERT: How do you know that? She leads him through the restaurant towards the back corner. There we find Nancy already seated at the table. * * *
ROBERT: Oh no.
HOSTESS: Enjoy your dinner ... The Hostess leaves as Robert stands there awkwardly.
NANCY: Dale and Brennan.
ROBERT: It had to be. I gotta say I'm impressed.
NANCY: Well what should we do?
ROBERT: Well I'm actually hungry.
NANCY: I'm fine with it if you are. Robert sits down.
ROBERT: So how was your day? MONTAGE: MUSIC: ART TATUM PIANO Shots of Robert and Nancy enjoying dinner, laughing, 100. selecting a bottle of wine, having what appears to be a great time.
NANCY: and it turned out she wasn't pregnant at all but had just had a nasty spider bite.
ROBERT: ... Ha, ha, ha ... Brennan and Dale enter the restaurant. Dale is playing guitar and Brennan is singing loudly and carrying a dozen roses.
DALE: Ladies and Gentlemen! Tonight, Prestige Entertainment, in conjunction with Don King Productions, presents a Night of Love! MUSIC: TONIGHT I CELEBRATE MY LOVE FOR YOU
BRENNAN: 
TONIGHT I CELEBRATE MY LOVE FOR YOU: 
IT SEEMS THE NATURAL THING TO DO: 
NANCY: Oh no. They come walking towards Nancy and Robert's table.
BRENNAN: TONIGHT NO ONE'S GONNA FIND US WE'LL LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND US
DALE AND BRENNAN: 
WHEN I MAKE LOVE TO YOU: They are now right in front of their table.
BRENNAN: 
TONIGHT ROBERT CELEBRATES HIS LOVE: 
FOR NANCY: LET'S HOPE THEY'LL GET BACK
TOGETHER SO THEIR SONS CAN HAVE A: HOME WITH CLEAN LAUNDRY!
MALE RESTAURANT PATRON: Shut up! You suck!
BRENNAN: Okay ... that kind of stung ... Ummm ... I might cry ... I told you I didn't want to sing Dale!
DALE: Don't listen to him. You sound great. Keep going! (continues singing)
TONIGHT I CELEBRATE MY LOVE FOR YOU: 
BRENNAN: Let's just move to the last part, okay?
DALE: Okay. Go! Dale keeps strumming as Brennan takes out some crumpled notebook paper. 101. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 102.
BRENNAN: Mom. I know that you love Robert. * And to remind you, here ' s a page * from your diary. * NANCY * Brennan, don't. * BRENNAN * "Today was a tough one. Robert * didn't want to have sex again. He * acted like it was because he was * tired but I think it's either his * anti-depressants or the fact that * he's just plain old and cannot * achieve consistent erections * anymore. But despite this, I still * love him" Do you hear that Robert? * She loves you. * ROBERT * I'm leaving. * Dale pushes his Dad back down. And then filling around the * table and entering from different points of the restaurant are Nancy's assistant, Robert's receptionist, Alice, Dr. Kalane, Mr. Weedle and Mrs. Lawson. DALE * Do you see how much people want you together? Because ...
TONIGHT NANCY AND ROBERT WILL GET: BACK TOGETHER ... Songs ends.
BRENNAN: All of the people from your life came here tonight just to tell you that they think it's crazy you two aren't together. DR. KALANE Actually I was told there was a medical emergency. NANCY'S ASSISTANT They told me you needed your cell phone charger. MR. WEEDLE Is Carol Mongh here? *
BRENNAN: Well?
ROBERT: Well what?
BRENNAN: Are you getting back together?
ROBERT: Absolutely not! That's not how life works. You don't lie to people, read pages from their diary and expect two people to get back together.
NANCY: I mean holy toledo! Come on guys, if this were in a movie it would be too much. EXT. SUBURBAN STREET -NIGHT 103. CUT TO: Dale and Brennan are walking down the street. Brennan is holding the guitar and Dale is on his bike. Beat. DALE Damn we got really close.
BRENNAN: I don't know, Robert was pretty direct about how they felt.
DALE: Ok here's my idea for the next plan. We call them up and say we're porno directors for the elderly and we tell them we think they're hot. And if they'll do our movie we pay them $10 million each. They have sex and realize that they're still in love and we're all back together.
BRENNAN: That is crazy, dumb and gross. * * *
DALE: You know what, you're crazy, dumb and gross. Dale shoves Brennan. Brennan looks up.
BRENNAN: Oh no. 104. They look up to see their house with a sheriff's car in front of it, with flashing lights. Two deputies are putting a padlock on the front door. Derek and one of his jackass friends are standing in front of the house smirking.
DEREK: Well if it isn't Captain Dick licker and his sidekick Sgt. Meat curtain! Guess what? I just put you in lockdown!
BRENNAN: You can't do this. That's our house!
DEREK: No see it's not your house. It's Dr. Robert Dobak's house and the sheriff happens to agree with me. EXT. HOUSE - NEXT MORNING Sun is rising up over the neighborhood. EXT. BACKYARD CUT TO: We push in on the tree fort to reveal that Dale and Brennan are jammed in there, sleeping.
BRENNAN: Dale, wake up! Hey!
DALE: Ow my back! My whole lower half is asleep.
BRENNAN: I'm starving man. How much money do we have left of the Prestige Entertainment/Alice money? *
DALE: Let's see, we spent two thousand dollars on pizza, four thousand on the flat screen, two thousand on the batting cage, then a thousand on miscellaneous and then the last thousand I just flat out, lost. I have no idea where it is.
BRENNAN: You lost a thousand dollars? How?
DALE: Well I got all the money in thousand dollar bills which was really fuckin cool and I think what happened was, I thought it was a single and I tipped the pizza guy with it.
BRENNAN: That's why he gave us all those breadsticks. Man, how are we gonna get food?
DALE: Is this crazy? Do we eat dog food until we get back on our feet?
BRENNAN: You can get through anything with a little bottle of Tabasco. The tree fort begins creaking and moaning.
BRENNAN: Uh-oh. 105. We see the entire tree fort fall from the tree to the ground and smash apart leaving Brennan and Dale strewn across the back lawn.
BRENNAN: Oooohhhh ... are you alright?
DALE: Yeah. I guess ...
BRENNAN: I think we should call Mom and Dad. * *
DALE: No! Then they'll think we don't know how to take care of ourselves. Listen, I think we can get more money from Alice ... Dale gets us and dusts himself off.
DALE: We're kind of lovers.
BRENNAN: What?
DALE: Do you remember Christmas dinner when we kept trying to bring the chair in?
BRENNAN: Yeah.
DALE: We were making it happen while we were talking to you.
BRENNAN: Holy shit dude! You laid my brother's wife! You laid her!
DALE: That's not how you use the word "laid." It's not a verb.
BRENNAN: I guess I'm not mad. I just felt like I should be. Truth is Derek cheats on her like crazy.
DALE: Alice believes in me. Hell, she believes in us. She may be our only hope. EXT. DEREK'S HOUSE -AN HOUR LATER 106. DISSOLVE TO: Big McMansion with Derek and Alice's car and a red Porshe' in the front driveway. 107. INT. DEREK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The doorbell rings it chimes with "Eye of the Tiger" and Alice answers the door. Dale and Brennan are there.
DAIE: We need your help Alice.
AIICE: You should have called.
BRENNAN: Hi Alice.
AIICE: Come in. They enter and in the living room sit Derek, Robert and Nancy.
DAIE: Mom! Dad!
NANCY: Hello boys.
BRENNAN: What are you doing here together?
ROBERT: We were sort of expecting you to show up here after Derek called the Sheriff.
NANCY: Listen guys ... relationships are tricky.
ROBERT: They are. There's an ebb and flow to the way people feel about each other. Love is a constant but sometimes it can get obscured.
BRENNAN: What does that mean?
DAIE: Are you pregnant Nancy?
DEREK: Hey fuck sticks! They've been together all along.
BRENNAN: Wha? You two were never divorced?
ROBERT: Absolutely not. Nancy is the love of my life. We were trying to create ... what's the word?
NANCY: Change. Positive change.
ROBERT: Basically we thought that if you two thought we were split up and there was no home, that maybe you'd go out on your own.
NANCY: But you didn't.
ROBERT: You two hung in there and stood up for what you believed in, like I've never seen. Unfortunately, what you believe in, is not working and living off your parents.
NANCY: Robert.
ROBERT: I don't say it in judgement. It's just a fact.
DALE AND BRENNAN: Thank you ... It was hard ... etc.
NANCY: So basically we're moving back into the house.
ROBERT: I've learned to accept that you two are just special. That you will never be full functioning adults. Heck, it could be a lot worse. There are some parents out there who have kids with down syndrome or who are addicted to crystal meth. 108.
BRENNAN: Yeah, we're not so bad!
DALE: So that's it? We're going to be a family again?
NANCY: Yes. We're a family again.
BRENNAN: Dale it all worked!
DALE: I knew it would. 109. They all have some sort of group hug. Alice joins in the hug.
ALICE: This is beautiful.
ROBERT: We just need you guys to sign some paperwork to make it all official. (yelling off camera) Bradley why don't you come out here! The door to the study opens up and a man in a suit, BRADLEY, 52, enters with a woman behind him, carrying some papers.
NANCY: This is Bradley Asher, Robert's attorney. Basically you'll be signing some papers that will make you our legal dependents.
BRADLEY: How are you boys today? Are you going to ride in a car and get ice cream? Ice cream is yummy!
ROBERT: Bradley! They're not like that!
BRADLEY: Oh. My apologies. What we have here is a standard form of dependency. This will give your parents control of your financial assets, power of attorney, also responsibility for all medical care. Basically it's the same kind of form you would see for a child in a vegetative state.
DALE: Why do we have to sign this?
BRADLEY: It's going to help Nancy and Robert with their taxes and make it easier for them to care for you.
BRENNAN: Score! So in other words, we're making out like bandits!
BRADLEY: Sure, I guess you are. I've never heard it expressed that way, in fact, most of the time people signing these types of documents can't speak.
BRENNAN: Where do I sign?
BRADLEY: Just in these fourteen places, starting here. And there. Initial here. Brennan is furiously signing the documents.
DALE: Can we slow down here?
ROBERT: Actually the sooner we get these signed, the sooner we can get ice cream!
BRENNAN: Yes! I wish I could write with both hands! 110. Dale is watching this with uneasiness. He looks over at Alice who is looking at him.
BRENNAN: Done! Get going Dale! Let's go!
DALE: I don't think I want to do this.
BRENNAN: Why are you being weird? This is it, we won. * *
DALE: This feels wrong Brennan.
BRENNAN: What are you talking about? This is everything we wanted. We get to live at home. Mom and dad are back together. Come on.
DALE: I don't know. It just seems for the first time ... pathetic.
BRENNAN: So you're not going to sign this?
DALE: No, I don't think I'm going to. Hey Derek, remember a long time ago, in the tree fort, you offered me a job?
DEREK: Yeah.
DALE: I think I want that job.
DEREK: You know it's a shitty job and I hate you and because I hate you, I'm going to bust your balls everyday?
DALE: Yeah, I think that's going to be okay.
BRENNAN: What are you doing Dale? We hate Derek.
DALE: I think you should take a job too.
BRENNAN: I don't know who I'm talking to anymore. All I know is I'm going to get some ice cream with my mom and dad. Later I'll probably light off some fireworks, have some pudding and start drawing pictures of the new tree fort, for the backyard. (MORE) 111. * * BRENNAN (cont'd) That's the real world Dale!! What you're talking about is crazy land!
DALE: It may be, but there's a part of me saying I've gotta do this! I feel alone, terrified and yet at the same time, I've never felt more alive! Alice runs up to Dale and starts kissing him.
ALICE: My god you're magnificent! I must have you!
DEREK: Hey! Alice what the fuck?!!
ALICE: Oh, I'm sorry, it's these diet pills I'm on. EXT. DEREK'S HOUSE MUSIC: "Don't Cry Out Loud" MELISSA MANCHESTER 112. CUT TO: We see Brennan's face pressed up against the back windshield of Robert and Nancy's car, as it pulls out of the driveway. Brennan is doing a silent yell behind the glass. Dale stands on the front lawn watching them pull away. CUT TO:
MONTAGE: l)Shot of hazmat crew cleaning out the house of pizza boxes and trash with Robert, Nancy and Brennan watching on. 2) Dale * * * is with a realtor who is showing him a studio apartment 3) Brennan plays Dale's drums and then slams the sticks down and * walks away 4) Dale sits at a desk in a tiny cubicle, at a giant office, filling out W2 form. Derek walks in, looks at the W2 form, tears it up and makes him fill out another one 5) Brennan puts on eye shadow and paints his pinky finger black. We see that he is going Goth 6) Dale is having a beer with a couple co-workers, they are all laughing, he seems awkward. Then Dale says something, they all laugh, Dale seems to loosen up. 10) Brennan, wearing all goth clothes and make- up, stands on the front lawn. 113. Chris Gardoki and the weird red-head ride by on their bikes. Brennan chases them and they are now afraid of him. CUT TO: INT. OFFICE -TWO MONTHS LATER Dale sits across from RANDY, 28, a mid-level manager at Derek's company.
RANDY: I gotta tell you when you set foot in this place we were all laughin' behind your back. Derek even said, "I'm hiring this guy for shits and giggles. He's a freak and he's probably gonna quit after a week." But you've hung in there.
DALE: Thanks Randy.
RANDY: And just the other day, I overheard the bossrnan say, "I gotta give it up, pussyboy turned out to be a half-decent shit shoveler."
DALE: It's been a good two months.
RANDY: Here's what's going on. Derek has decided to throw some actual, real responsibility your way. Little thing called the Catalina wine mixer, it's our marquee event every year. We get all the heavy hitters, I'm talking Raytheon, GE, Northrup, all corning out, looking to be wined and dined, mostly wined, so we can tell them about our leasing options on our helicopters. It's a big deal. It's the fuckin' Catalina wine mixer.
DALE: Ok. So what would be my responsibilities Randy? *
RANDY: We'll first off you gotta make sure there is enough wine and food for sixty to one hundred people. And then there's the music. We got to make sure there is a live musical act that flat out nails it. Let me just give you an idea of what you're up against. Last year we had Donna Abdul, Paula Abdul's mother and she brought it. She brought every bit of it.
DALE: Paula Abdul's morn is a singer?
RANDY: Yes. Do you own a radio? Specifically a ham radio, because that's how she broadcasts her shit?!!
DALE: I think I'm getting the idea.
RANDY: You better be. It's the Catalina wine mixer and it is the big leagues. You're gonna have to have a big ol' pair of hairy, veiny balls to get through this one. 114. Randy just stares at Dale, breathing a little to hard.
DALE: Is there a problem Randy?
RANDY: It's the Catalina wine mixer!!! You nail this or you're gone! Simple as that. I'm gonna be breathing up your ass the whole way. So guess what hombre, if you know a world class singer, now is the time to make that phone call! INT. DALE AND BRENNAN'S BEDROOM CUT TO: Brennan is now full goth, eye shadow, painted fingernails, earrings, black lipstick and a tuxedo t-shirt. * * 115. He lies on his bed listening to the Cure, "Boys Don't Cry". Nancy peaks into the room holding a cordless phone.
NANCY: Would you turn down that music!? Brennan?! Brennan!? Finally Brennan gets up and turns down the music.
BRENNAN: What mom!?
NANCY: What has gotten into you? With the music and the hair and make-up?
BRENNAN: Can't you see!? I've gone goth because I feel sad inside!!
NANCY: Well I'm very sorry that you feel sad inside, but your stepbrother Dale is on the phone and he would like to talk to you. She hands him the phone and walks out.
BRENNAN: Hello.
DALE: Hey bro. I don't have a lot of time so I'm going to make this real simple. I need your help. I need the best singer in the world.
BRENNAN: Sorry ... I'm busy.
DALE: Brennan, it's okay if you're scared. I'm scared too.
BRENNAN: I'm not scared! And besides, don't you remember what that guy yelled at me at the restaurant with Mom and Dad? I suck! So leave me alone! Brennan hangs up the phone, turns up the Cure and instantly starts crying. DISSOLVE TO: * * * * * * * * EXT. CATALINA ISLAND - DAY It's a gorgeous day off Catalina Island. Sailboats cut through the waves as we push in. EXT. CATALINA CASINO - CONTINUOUS 116. We see the landmark Catalina Casino right on the water's edge. There's a medium sized function going on. About sixty businessmen mill about in shirts and ties drinking wine and eating hors doerves A small four piece band plays some Chuck * Mangione, "Feels So Good" with organ, bass, trumpet and drums. Dale is in the middle of it with huge pit stains looking very nervous. A banner hangs over the function that says, "STEEL RAVEN EXECUTIVE HELICOPTERS" MUSIC: Feels So Good
ORGAN PLAYER: Come on everyone! That's it! Huh­ huh! Come on everyone! My name's Gavin! Come on everyone! Dale's Manager Randy comes up to him.
DALE: Hey Randy. It's going pretty good, huh?
RANDY: You know what, you've got a real problem with your band. Food and wine is not bad, but this band blows. The organ player won't stop saying, "Come on everyone".
ORGAN PLAYER: Come on everyone! Let's go!
DALE: I don't think it's that big a deal. At that moment Derek walks up.
DEREK: What the fuck's wrong with the music?! That guy won't stop saying, "Come on everyone"! I got clients leaving the wine mixer, left and right. (MORE) DEREK (cont'd) If you don't fix this in the next ten seconds, you're fired Dale! 117. Dale runs over to the singer. People are starting to leave.
ORGAN PLAYER: Hey where's everyone going? Come on everybody!
DALE: Hey! Can you stop saying, "Come on everybody"! People are starting to leave.
ORGAN PLAYER: No can do. People like to be included in on the journey. Besides it's my signature move. Randy pulls the plug on the band and steps on the stage.
RANDY: I'm sorry everyone, we're having some technical difficulties with the music! We're going to fix it right away!
ORGAN PLAYER: Come on man! Derek shows up and gets in Dale's face.
DEREK: I knew we shouldn't have give you this responsibility. You're just a big baby! I knew we shouldn't have hired you!
RANDY: It's the fuckin' Catalina Wine Mixer!
DALE: It doesn't seem that bad. Let me go find a boom box or something.
DEREK: (mocking) "Let me go find a boom box or something"! No! It's done! You've screwed up the Catalina Wine Mixer! I don't hear any music, you're fired!! We now hear Brennan's voice o.c. BRENNAN (O.C.) TURNAROUND, EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE BIT LONELY AND YOU'RE
NEVER COMING ROUND: We see Brennan in a billowing white cotton shirt, black leather pants, neatly trimmed five o'clock shadow and 118. sandals. We've never seen him like this before, he looks good and is very confident.
BRENNAN: TURNAROUND, EVERY NOW AND THEN I
GET A LITTLE BIT TIRED OF LISTENING: 
TO THE SOUND OF MY TEARS: 
DEREK: What the hell is he doing?
DALE: He's singing. And it's beautiful! Brennan is walking through the crowd, he strokes a woman's cheek.
BRENNAN: TURNAROUND BRIGHT EYES,
EVERY NOW AND THEN I FALL APART: Drums kick in and we see that Dale is playing. People are filing back in.
BRENNAN: 
I NEED YOU NOW TONIGHT AND I NEED: 
YOU MORE THAN EVER: Rest of the band starts to kick in.
BRENNAN: AND IF YOU ONLY HOLD ME TIGHT WE'LL
BE HOLDING ON: 
DALE: 
FOREVER: 
BRENNAN: 
TOGETHER WE CAN TAKE IT TO THE END OF THE LINE YOUR LOVE IS LIKE A: 
SHADOW ON ME ALL OF THE TIME: 
DALE: All OF THE TIME
BRENNAN: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I'M ALWAYS IN THE DARK WE'RE LIVING IN
A POWDER KEG AND GIVING OFF SPARKS: 
DALE: 
GIVING OFF SPARKS: 
BRENNAN: I REALLY NEED YOU TONIGHT FOREVER'S GONNA START TONIGHT FOREVER'S GONNA START TONIGHT 119. Dale steps out from the drums to the front of stage with Brennan.
BRENNAN AND DALE: (harmony)
ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS FALLING IN: LOVE BUT NOW I'M ONLY FALLING APART THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO A TOTAL
ECLIPSE OF THE HEART: 
BRENNAN: 
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS LIGHT IN: MY LIFE BUT NOW THERE'S ONLY LOVE
IN THE DARK NOTHING I CAN SAY A: 
TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART: 
DALE: 
TURN AROUND BRIGHT EYES: Brennan finishes with an insane note that is either great or awful, depending on your upbringing.
BRENNAN: ECLIPSE OF THE HEART!!! Dale hugs Brennan. We see that everyone has returned to the wine mixer, including hotel staff and extra boats have pulled up to the water's edge. A guy with a Raytheon name tag starts applauding. Then another from GE, Bechtel, Northrup, Carlysle Group, etc. all start applauding.
DALE: You saved me!
BRENNAN: No brother, we saved us!
CROWD: Encore! More! That was fantastic!
ORGAN PLAYER: Come on everyone! Derek hops up on stage.
DEREK: You did good Dale. People are leasing helicopters like crazy.
DALE: Thanks but what about Brennan?
BRENNAN: Dale don't-
DEREK: What about him? One song doesn't make up for forty years of being a freak.
DALE: You know what? I've been wanting to do this since I started working for you. 120. He winds up to punch him but instead Brennan punches him really hard in the a=.
DEREK: Ow! That hurt. You used the knuckle! Get out of here! Both of you! Dale and Brennan walk away.
BRENNAN: That felt good but I wish we could have made him lick white dog crap. Denise walks up to Brennan.
DENISE: That was the bravest thing I have ever seen.
BRENNAN: Denise? I can't believe you came. * * * * * *
DENISE: I figured I'd hide in the back of the crowd in case you did something fucked up. But that was ... that was great. She kisses him lightly on the lips.
BRENNAN: I hate to be rude but my Step Bro and I need some time.
DENISE: I completely understand. I'll call you later. EXT. DECK OF LARGE COMMUTER BOAT - SUNSET 121. CUT TO: Dale and Brennan are standing on the outside deck, near the front of the boat. It's probably too choppy to be standing out there and the guys are having to speak pretty loudly over the wind.
DALE: That really means a lot to me what you did out there. I know that couldn't have been easy for you. Do you mind me asking? What made you do it?
BRENNAN: I was just laying in our room and I looked at your empty bed, and I thought if you can't break out and take a risk for your stepbrother, then who can you take a risk for? A DECK HAND, 25, calls out at them.
DECK HAND: Guys!! You can be out there. That section is off limits for the general public! Don't want to have to say it again! Dale and Brennan both give him a thumbs up and keep talking.
BRENNAN: What do we do now? You've lost your job. * * * * * * * * * * * *
DALE: Doesn't matter. What happened today was special. We've both taken important steps.
BRENNAN: You know it's true. I feel like I can do anything! In fact, I was thinking, you know how it's a huge pain to make dinner reservations? What if we created a service, where people call us and tell us what time they want to have dinner and how many are in their party, and we take it from there?
DALE: But isn't that exactly what you do when you make a dinner reservation yourself?
BRENNAN: No, think about it. You're leaving out some steps, that we would eliminate-122. The boat hits a huge wave and pitched both guys overboard.
DALE AND BRENNAN: Aawwww! ! The boat hits a siren and starts to turn around. BOAT LOUDSPEAKER (O.C.) MAN OVERBOARD! MAN OVERBOARD! INT. SHIP -FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER Dale and Brennan are both wrapped up in blankets, drinking mugs of coffee.
DECK HAND: I told you guys no less than three times that you were not supposed to be standing out there!
DALE: You absolutely did and we did not listen and we are sorry for it.
DECK HAND: I tell you this much, you are lucky to be alive. They sit there shivering, sipping their coffee.
DALE: Can I ask you something? And you can be honest. I don't care anymore. But did you touch my drum set when you first moved in?
BRENNAN: Honestly? No. I did not. 123. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NANCY AND ROBERT'S HOUSE - CHRISTMAS A YEAR LATER The house is decorated with lights, looks very festive. INT. DINING ROOM A big Christmas dinner is going on. Seated around the table are Robert and Nancy; Derek and Alice, Trevor, Tiffany and Tommy; Dale is in a police uniform; and Brennan sits next to Denise. *
DEREK: So our hover craft is cutting across the Everglades. And I'm there with former NFL coach, Jimmy Johnson, Geraldo Rivera, and Tia Carrera, and all of a sudden we look ahead-
DALE: Yeah, yeah that's great Derek. You know what happened to us yesterday? A bank robbery!
THE KIDS: Oooo!!! Tell us about that, uncle Dale!!
ROBERT: Wow. That sounds exciting Dale!
DALE: Well it was pretty intense. But we got in there and it turns out it was a false alarm, but I did get to draw my gun. I told someone to freeze ... who later turned out to work at the bank.
THE KIDS: Wow! That's so cool.
NANCY: What about you Brennan? We're so excited about your engagement party!
DENISE: I know Nancy, I got your five messages yesterday.
NANCY: If you need help with anything, don't hesitate to call.
BRENNAN: Well I have some other news. You all know how I flew out to St. Louis for the American Idol audition and it turned out I was way too old. And some guys took my luggage and things got really scary.
ROBERT: Sure we remember, it got real hairy out there. Those guys called themselves the St. Lunatics had circled you, brandishing box cutters?
BRENNAN: Well do you remember the guy who saved me? The guy who stepped into the alley and said, "Hey leave him alone! He's part of my dogpound!" That man was Randy Jackson and we got to talking. And I sang for him, which he asked me not to do, but I did anyway. I don't know if you remember a group called the Thompson Twins. They were gigantic. I mean bigger than the Beatles. (MORE) 124. * BRENNAN (cont'd) They might be doing a cruise ship tour and there is a chance that I could sing backup for them. Everyone applauds.
ROBERT: That's outstanding!
NANCY: Brennan I knew it! I knew it!
DEREK: Thompson Twins are pretty cool. Maybe we'll look into going on that cruise. 125. We start to pull out on the scene as everyone talks and eats and laughs.
FADE OUT ALICE: This chair is really bad for my back. Dale can you help me get another one?
DALE: Uh yeah, sure.
